History of Present Illness :
HPI: Pt is a 71 y/o male with h/o dm2 , cad s/p cabg , DVT/PE on long term anti-coagulation , ulcerative colitis on Asacol presents with brbpr starting at 9am of the morning of admission .
He 'd been having lower abdominal pain for approximately the past week , a symptom for which he 's been admitted in the past .
His PCP had recently started ciprofloxacin for a UTI . 
At 9am the morning of admission he passed a large , bloody bowel movement and came to the Michael . There , his vitals were intially stable with a hct of 36.7 , though he was felt to be hypovolemic and this hemoconcentrated ; his previous hct was 39 about five months ago .
He refused an NG lavage .
Although an initial DRE showed only clot , he later passed a large , bloody bowel movement , and his bp nadired to the low 90's but rested there only transiently and easily rebounded to the 130's-140's with fluid ; he then went to angiography for a tagged RBC scan where they found and embolized two vessels to the sigmoid colon .
His HCT had dropped from 36.7 to 30.8 despite 2U PRBC and 3 U FFP .
Is called out of the FICU as has been been HD and stable HCT .
Currently denies CP , SOB , abd pain or continued BRBPR .

GI BLEEDING STUDY
2012-10-31
IMPRESSION : Increased tracer activity demonstrated within the left lower quadrant , most likely sigmoid colonic loops of bowel , consistent with active bleeding .
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST
2012-10-31 3:27 PM
IMPRESSION :
1. No evidence of colitis or other bowel pathology present to explain the patient 's bright red blood per rectum .
2. Stable appearance of left adrenal fat-containing lesion consistent with a myelolipoma .
3. Stable appearance of hypodense lesion within the caudate lobe of the liver , too small to fully characterize .
4. Subcentimeter attenuation lesion within the lower pole of the right kidney , too small to characterize .
5. 3-mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule within the right lower lobe . 
If the patient does not have a history of a primary malignancy , followup CT of the chest in 1 year is recommended to evaluate for stability of this finding .
Brief Hospital Course :
Initial A/P :
71 y/o male with dm2 , cad , chf , uc presents with one week of lower abdominal pain and 2 episodes of brpbr on the day of admission .
# BRBPR -- The patient was in the intensive care unit given his lower GI bleed .
An angiography showed bleeding in two vessels off of the Minnie supplying the sigmoid that were succesfully embolized .
The patient was transfused from a Hct 29 to 34 on the day of discharge .
His coumadin was held during his stay given his acute bleed but restarted per his PCP with the guidance of GI on the day of discharge .
- The patient underwent a flex sigmoidoscopy on Friday , 11-02 , which showed old blood in the rectal vault but no active source of bleeding .
Given this , it was advised that the patient have a colonoscopy to rule out further bleeding .
- The patient had a colonoscopy on Monday 11-05 but unfortunately , was unable to complete the study as his bowel 
prep was inadequate .
Therefore , he had a repeat colonoscopy on 11-06 which showed expected mucosal signs of moderate ulcerative colitis , no polyps , w/ 8 mm ulcer at junction of distal descending colon and sigmoid colon .
- Biopsies were obtained during his colonoscopy and he should follow up with gastroenterology for the results .
# Ulcerative colitis -- The patient 's Asacol was originally held but restarted the day prior to discharge per GI .
# CAD/CHF - The patient was restarted on his home regimen prior to discharge as it was held temporarily given his acute GI bleed .
The exception is that per his PCP , Jason aspirin will be held for 2 weeks given that he was restarted on coumadin with 
his risk of bleeding .
# DM-2 -- The patient was maintained on his home insulin regimen .
# h/o DVT/PE :
Coumadin was initially held .
It was unclear at first as to why the patient required life-long anticoagulation .
After discussing this with his PCP , Leon was clear that the patient had had recurrent DVTs and ultimately a PE and his PCP felt strongly that he required long-term anticoagulation .
His goal INR should be 1.6-2.0 . If bleeding continues to occur , consider V. Winchester filter .
# Access -- 2 large bore PIV's

She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys .
Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal .
Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is an 80 year old female with a history of Stage I breast cancer , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , who presents with a leukocytosis/bandemia , hypotension in the setting of dehydration and influenza .
After a short Medical Intensive Care Unit course where she remained hemodynamically stable , she was transferred to the floor .
Gerardi problem list is as follows :
Hypotension - This was likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of a diarrheal and viral respiratory syndrome .
Her blood pressure was stable after three liters of normal saline .
She was clinically euvolemic after that .
She did receive two units of packed red blood cells .
There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleed or adrenal insufficiency during the course of her evaluation .
Her antihypertensives were initially held and reinstated upon discharge .
Influenza A - DFA confirmed , the viral cultures were pending at the time of discharge .
The initial bandemia would not have been consistent with a typical influenza presentation , so she was continued on a fourteen day course of Levaquin to eliminate any possibility of a bacterial superinfection or early pneumonia .
Loose bowel movements - This problem was resolved and had been a viral syndrome on presentation .
There was no evidence of diarrhea during medical Lawrence Memorial Hospital stay .
Anemia - This is a chronic problem .
She has known iron deficiency .
There was no evidence of bleeding .
She was guaiac negative and the Hemophilus panel was negative .

HOSPITAL COURSE and OUTCOME : 
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service and commenced amiodarone loading . 
Adenosine stress MIBI revealed a small reversible defect in the PDA territory and the patient underwent coronary catheterisation on 1/6/0004 which revealed a 70% lesion in the SVG to PDA -> cypher stented successfully . 
He had occasional ventricular extopyon telemetry but no further recurrence of ventricular tachycardia . 
During his admission , his am fasting glucose levels were intermittently elevated and his HbA1C was greater than 7 . 
I have explained to him that he may have developed some glucose intolerance and that , in the first instance , he should see his Primary Care Physician and attempt dietary control . 
On the day prior to discharge he noticed a small area of erythema surrounding his R antecubital venous access site . 
This will be treated empirically with a 10 day course of Keflex . 
I have instructed him to see his PCP if it does not improve in a few days or if he develops fevers . 
In terms of his amiodarone , he will be discharged on 400mg po bid for a further 7 days followed by 400mg qd thereafter . 
He will followup with Dr. Levels in device clinic in 4 weeks . 
I have advised him that he must not drive until he is seena gain in clinic and his device interrogated .

He had been at home drinking fluids trying to flush his system .
He was strongly encouraged to come in by his mother and was admitted through the emergency room .
On date of admission , the patient 's sodium was 134 , his chloride was 98 , CO2 28 , BUN 5 , creatinine 0.06 with a glucose of 104 .
His LFTs showed total protein of 7.7 , total bilirubin of 4.5 , direct bilirubin of 2.5 , ALT of 78 , AST of 213 , alkaline phosphatase of 113 with a lipase of 242 .
The patient 's CBC showed a WBC count of 21.1 , hemoglobin 12.7 , hematocrit of 36.8 , and MCV of 105 , MCH of 36.3 with platelets of 177 .

His abdominal CT showed progressive cirrhotic change within the liver with new evidence of portal hypertension including large abdominal ascites , perigastric , and paraesophageal varices , and reconstituted periumbilical vein .
He also had sigmoid diverticula without evidence for acute diverticulitis .
The patient was admitted for acute alcoholic hepatitis .
He had a GI evaluation with Dr. **NAME[TTT] who consulted the hepatologist Dr. **NAME[SSS RRR] at **PHONE regarding Mr. **NAME[AAA] .
He was thought to be a candidate for steroid therapy and Trental .
Steroids are a double-edged sword , however , and we need to be vigilant regarding infection control and with this patient 's glucose control as he is diabetic .
Dr. **NAME[RRR] will be happy to follow the patient at **INSTITUTION .
Other recommendations are the patient will have a paracentesis with cell count , C and S , and total protein which has been done , 2.5 L was removed from the patient .
The fluid removed was yellow clear in color .

Brief Hospital Course :
This 62 year-old obese male was admitted with cellulitis and presumed bacteremia .
In the John , he was found to be in hypotensive atrial fibrillation .
The patient was admitted to the Medical ICU where his hypotension was managed with IVF hydration and he was maintained on a diltiazam drip for atrial fibrillation .
After his heart rate was controlled , he was transitioned to oral medications and transferred to the medicine service .
1. Cellulitis / Bacteremia
Review of the medical record revealed several previous admissions for cellulitis and bacteremia .
Blood cultures on this admission and were positive for Beta streptococcus Group B .
The patient had previous episodes of the same infection , with lower extremity cellulitis the likely source .
A left lower extremity ultrasound was negative for deep venous thrombosis .
The patient was too large to have a CTA .
He was initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn while awaiting culture results .
Once the organism was identified , he was transitioned to a regimen of intravenous penicillin and oral levofloxacin , which had successfully treated the infection during his most recent admission 1 year prior .
He completed 7 days of levofloxacin and had a PICC line placed to facilitate a 2 week course of IV Penicillin .
2. Atrial fibrillation
The patient 's development of atrial fibrillation was believed to be secondary to infection and structural heart disease .
It was initially managed with intravenous diltiazam , and it was later managed with metoprolol and anticoagulation .
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mildly dilated and elongated left atrium , with a markedly dilated right atrium .
He had occasional episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation that were controlled with responded to IV metoprolol .
However , his rate proved difficult to control despite metoprolol and diltiazam .
The EP service was consulted and recommended transesophageal echocardiogram and cardioversion .
The TEE was negative for thrombus and the patient was successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm with ibutilide .
He was subsequently started on amiodarone and is scheduled to complete a 10 week course .
EKG before discharge showed mild QT prolongation and no effect from amiodarone .
EKG and LFTs should be monitored by his PCP , William given the high dose of amiodarone he will receive .
3. FEN
He was followed by the nutrition team throughout his admission and their recommendations were followed .
He demonstrated several asymptomatic electrolyte deficiecies ; these were likely due to inadequate absorption following his surgery and he responded well to repletion .
Vitamin D and parathyroid tests were pending at the time of discharge .
The patient was discharged to Kindred Park View Specialty Hospital of Springfield Rehabilitation Hospital in good condition .
He was sent with a King of Hearts monitor and scheduled for follow-up with cardiology and his primary care physician .

He continued to have intermittent symptoms and was noted to have some fullness in the suprapatellar pouch .
Plain films taken by his orthopedist in Mongcana Ster Staarv revealed some soft tissue calcification within the medial and lateral compartments of the joint .
an magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated calcification densities in the suprapatellar bursa region , also with hypertrophia of the synovium .
It was felt that the patient had synovial chondromatosis and would benefit from an open synovectomy and debridement .
He was admitted for that procedure .

ADMISSION DATE :

DISCHARGE DATE :

REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Paroxysmal events of unclear etiology , rule out seizures .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old male with no significant past medical history who presented to an outside hospital Emergency Department with a second episode consisting of right sided paresthesias that began in the upper extremity and spread through the torso into the lower extremity concomitant with palpitations and a subjective olfactory sensation of smelling rubbing alcohol .
These events were not associated with an abnormality of consciousness , a loss of consciousness or an altered mental status .
There was no adventitious motor activity .
The patient did describe anxiety feelings during these episodes and did have diaphoresis .
At the outside facility presumptively Mr. **NAME[AAA] 's urine toxicology was positive for cocaine .
At the outside facility as well the EKG showed a sinus rhythm .
A head CT without contrast was normal .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] was subsequently transferred to the Inpatient Neurology Ward Service at **INSTITUTION Hospital for further evaluation .
This evaluation consisted of laboratory studies , which showed a basically normal basic metabolic panel and troponins that were negative serially x 2 .
AP and lateral view of the chest was unremarkable .
Urine toxicology screen confirmed cocaine metabolites in the urine .
The patient also underwent MR scanning of the brain including diffusion and perfusion with his imaging as well as epilepsy protocol imaging , which was unremarkable .
There was no restrictive diffusion .
There was no abnormal parenchymal signal .
There were no masses identified .
There was no abnormal enhancement .
MR angiography of the anterior and extracranial vessels was non-revealing and unremarkable .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] also underwent electroencephalogram of the brain , which is currently not finalized ; however , was without epileptiform , lateralizing or localizing features .
During hospitalization , Mr. **NAME[AAA] remained neurologically intact and without deficits .
He had no recurrent episodes as previously described but did have 1 episode of palpitations and anxiety with a sinus tachycardia to approximately 100 beats per minute that reverted spontaneously .
This was not associated with paresthesias or abnormal sensorium .
We had a long discussion about the differential diagnosis with Mr. **NAME[AAA] including simple partial seizures , anxiety attacks , anxiety possibly related to cocaine use or atypical migraines .
Since the etiologies of these events are unclear and they are not associated with an abnormal sensorium or an alteration of consciousness , we have elected to gather further data prior to initiating anti - epileptic medications if at all .
We have instructed Mr. **NAME[AAA] at length that he should contact our clinic if he has any further episodes and if these episodes progress or change in symptomatology and certainly if they include an alteration of consciousness or abnormal motor activity that he should present emergently to the Emergency Department .
We also have instructed him that should he have palpitations , lightheadedness , diaphoresis , chest pain , shortness of breath , etc. , he should present to the Emergency Department immediately as well .
We will be obtaining a 24 - hour Holter monitor on discharge as well as setting Mr. **NAME[AAA] up for a prolonged ambulatory EEG in an attempt to capture these spells .
Therefore , Mr. **NAME[AAA] will be discharged home with follow up as noted below on **DATE[Dec 29 07] without complications .

This is a transfer progress note .
The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old male who was admitted to the cardiovascular unit because of retroperitoneal hematoma .
The patient sustained a retroperitoneal hematoma secondary to a fall on the regular floor , and the patient was on heparin and Coumadin during that time , which was subsequently discontinued .
However , the patient underwent an IVC filter placement , care of Dr. **NAME[UUU] for the prevention of pulmonary embolism from his DVT of the left leg .
During admission , the patient developed pleural effusion which was increasing in amount .
Dr. **NAME[TTT] performed diagnostic paracentesis on this patient and withdrew bloody fluid .
We consulted Dr. **NAME[SSS] for possible chest tube placement ; however , the patient did not want any further intervention at this time .
Risks and benefits were weighed , and it was decided that chest tube placement will be deferred at this time .
The patient also developed pseudocolonic obstruction and the patient was also transiently put on NPO , put on IV fluids , and had a rectal tube placed .
A repeat KUB of the abdomen showed resolving ileus , and the patient was subsequently started on clear liquids .
Currently , the patient is hemodynamically stable .
Hemoglobin and hematocrit are holding up adequately , and the patient is not complaining of any abdominal or retroperitoneal pain .
In the future , the patient might need some form of anticoagulation which is deferred for now .
The patient is deemed ready for transfer to the regular floor .

Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
2/15/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
2/28/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , without remission , atrial fibrillation , chronic airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .
Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .
He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .
He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .
He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler .
Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol .
He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .
He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .
There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .
He had no cardiac murmur .
His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .
The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta &apos;s , 3 nucleated red blood cells .
There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes .
The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 .
His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal .
His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 .
A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses .
There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .
An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .
He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .
He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .
His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .
There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .
Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .
Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .
A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .
He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .
The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin .
The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .
He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .
They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .
No autopsy was obtained .

This is a patient , who just arrived to 4G ICU , transferred from the trauma room after she was involved in a motor vehicle collision .
She is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old woman who was found to have a possible C3 spine fracture .
The patient was involved in an unrestrained driver collision with a severe laceration of the head .
She had a CT of the head that showed a very small subarachnoid hemorrhage .
The initial x-ray workup included a chest CT and abdominal CT .
This does not appear to show any abnormalities ; however , her hematocrit had dropped to 25 since she came to the trauma room .
She is on Plavix for possible cardiac disease .
She has a history of having had a coronary bypass .
When the patient arrived in the ICU she was borderline hypotensive with the blood pressure ranging between 98 and 85 systolic .
She received two boluses of 250 of Hespan and she had a central line in the femoral vein placed under my supervision and an arterial line in the femoral artery also placed under my supervision .
We elected to place these groin lines because the patient is on Plavix and at this point we will not proceed with the subclavian line , at least for the time being .
We will transfuse her with 6 units of platelets and we will transfuse her with two units of red cells .
The Spine Service will see her to establish and plan further management of a possible spine fracture .
Neurosurgery has already seen her and has not recommended any further intervention at this point except for observation .
The patient will be managed and controlled with Fentanyl and a small dose of Propofol while she is on the ventilator .
Because the patient now has some degree of hemodynamic instability , we will proceed with an EKG and a STAT echocardiogram to address the possibility of myocardial ischemia , we will also request a number of troponins , and we will review the EKG .
She remains with a heart rate of about 70 .
She may be under beta blocker and she may have some underlying cardiac disease , which will need to be investigated over the next few hours .
After the bolus of 500 mL of Hespan , her pressure is 115 right now .
She will remain in the ICU on the ventilator .
We will continue to monitor her hemodynamic status carefully .
We will review the films and rule out other sources of bleeding .
We will obtain a cardiology consult and if she continues to have evidence of cardiac ischemia .
I , Dr. **NAME[XXX] , was present for her assessment and dictation for 35 minutes at the bedside plus a central line in the vein and arterial line in the femoral artery .

Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at Vanor .
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
On ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .
She was evaluated by Dr. Mielke , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .
She was admitted to Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
She was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
02/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in 03/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Emaciated white female in mild respiratory distress .
Temperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .
HEENT :
Dry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .
NECK :
No lymphadenopathy .
CHEST :
Few inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .
ABDOMEN :
Well healed Pfannenstiel scars and no masses .
PELVIC :
No masses .
RECTAL :
No masses and guaiac negative .
EXTREMITIES :
No edema or cyanosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .
PT and PTT were 12 and 26 .
Electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was no evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06/18 .
She was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .
Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .
She was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed by Dr. Mielke and home care services .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Premarin 0.625 q.d. , Proventil Inhaler two puffs q.i.d. , Beclovent four puffs b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , MS Contin 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Trilisate 750 mg p.o. b.i.d. , MS Elixir 100 mg p.o. q.2h. p.r.n. , Robitussin with Codeine 5 cc p.o. q.2h. , and home O2 two liters via nasal prong with increase to four liters as needed for symptoms p.r.n.

BRIEF HISTORY :
Ms. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old female sent to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] for her AML which was initially diagnosed in **DATE[Mar 2005] and underwent consolidation and had complete remission .
Relapse occurred in **DATE[Mar 2006] , and she was treated by mitoxantrone and VP - 16 and 2 cycles of consolidation .
Unfortunately , she was not able to undergo stem cell transplant and then had recurrence again in **DATE[Mar 2007] .
At this point , she had 2 cycles of Mylotarg .
Her disease continues to progress , and she will be admitted for FLAG .
On admission , her vital signs were within normal limits , and her physical exam was unremarkable .
Further details can be found in the complete H and P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. **NAME[AAA] was admitted to the hospital for treatment of her AML .
For her relapsed AML , she was started on the FLAG protocol .
The disease and the treatment caused constant pancytopenia , and she required frequent blood transfusions especially with platelets .
She was also started on growth factor support with Neupogen .
Due to her prolonged neutropenia , Infectious Disease was consulted , and they started her on pentamidine for PCP pneumonia prophylaxis .
During her chemotherapy and the weeks following it , she needed diligent electrolyte correction , and this was performed by Dr. **NAME[PPP] who also coordinated her treatment plan .
She did develop problems with severe hemorrhoids , and GI was consulted .
They could not find any infection or abscesses associated with the hemorrhoids and treated her with conservative measures such as sitz baths and Anusol .
She does have an anxiety disorder at baseline , and it was increased during her stay .
Behavioral Health was consulted , and Ativan dose required adjusting .
Later , Xanax was added .
She did develop fevers from her prolonged neutropenia and had positive blood cultures .
She was started on cefepime and acyclovir by Infectious Disease .
Later , daptomycin was started .
Her infections were thought to be just from the sepsis , and perhaps , the port was infected ; and frequent cultures were followed .
On day 19 , caspofungin was also added for her continued fevers .
She developed some mucositis , and this was treated with acyclovir and ( _______________ ) .
On day 23 , she became confused .
She had difficulties performing her activities of daily living and required assistance with walking .
Dr. **NAME[SSS] of Neurology was consulted as well as Psychiatry with Dr. **NAME[QQQ] .
She had a stat CT scan to look for any abnormalities , especially since she had thrombocytopenia , to rule out a bleed .
She was diagnosed with delirium and treated with many medications , and several medications were discontinued including her Xanax , Ativan , and pain medication .
Also throughout her stay , diarrhea was a consistent problem .
Flagyl was added to treat the Clostridium difficile colitis .
GI was on board for the hemorrhoids and did follow her for the diarrhea as well .
She also had increased liver function tests , and this was secondary to cholestasis and resolved at this time .
With this treatment plan , Ms. **NAME[AAA] improved , she became afebrile , the hemorrhoids resolved , the mucositis resolved , and she returned to her baseline of mental status .
She became less transfusion dependent and was able to be discharged .

I am seeing this critically ill woman for management of respiratory insufficiency and atrial fibrillation .
I have examined the patient , reviewed the laboratory data , chest x-ray film , and events of the evening .
She underwent pulmonic valve repair yesterday , went back to the OR for bleeding after multiple units of blood were given .
Bleeding was terminated in the OR .
She has done well .
From a respiratory standpoint , she has bilateral infiltrates still , but her Aa gradient is reasonable and has come down to 40% , 5 of PEEP , and she looks fairly comfortable on CPAP .
She has a PO2 of 111 .
She is only positive of about a liter at this point , given good urinary input as well as the bleeding that she had .
I would favor giving her a trial of extubation .
She has an ASD repair .
Will start her ultimately on some aspirin .
She had some rapid atrial fibrillation last evening .
She has been on Cardizem , and I have asked to wean that off .
She is currently in a sinus rhythm .
She is warm and well perfused .
Continue with GI prophylaxis .
Keep the chest tubes in place at this point .
T = 30

I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male who has the complications of gallstone pancreatitis currently with an abdominal phlegmon , possible bile leak and now with sepsis and ARDS .
I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the Vascular and General surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Sepsis .
Over the last 24 hours , I have been able to wean his norepinephrine off .
He feels warm , dry , and well perfused peripherally on examination , although he is becoming somewhat more edematous with his capillary leak .
In terms of his antibiotics , Infectious Disease is now recommending a switch from Tigecycline to linezolid and I have started him on meropenem as we stopped Tigecycline to maintain broad spectrum , Gram-negative , and anaerobic coverage .
I have left him on his _________ in light of his multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas and the MIC 's on the
Pseudomonas have returned and it is sensitive to __________ .
I have ordered some repeat blood cultures today to make sure that we have cleared his sepsis .
His PTC catheter is in place and draining well .
2. Respiratory failure / ARDS .
Chest x-ray shows diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates and a tracheal tube is in good position .
Bronchoalveolar lavage is so far unremarkable .
Today , I have tried to wean his FiO2 down as tolerated , but he has not done well with that .
I have him on a tidal volume of 350 with a rate of 20 giving his peak airway pressures in the low 30 's .
Arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.25 and a pO2 of 77 , both of which are adequate given his severe lung disease .
3. Status post SMA aneurysm repair .
I have him back on his heparin drip .
PTT is 35 and we are increasing gradually .
4. ICU prophylaxis .
I have placed him back on his TPN and started him on some q. 6 hourly sliding - scale insulin .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .

REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Intracranial hemorrhage .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a very pleasant **AGE[in 80s]- year - old male with a past medical history dyslipidemia , coronary artery disease , hypertension , one episode of atrial fibrillation , and benign prostatic hypertrophy who presented with acute onset of difficulty using his right hand .
He was evaluated in the **INSTITUTION Emergency Department and underwent a CT scan of the brain , which showed a small left prefrontal hematoma .
Subsequently , he underwent an MRI of the brain as well as MR angiography of the head and the neck which showed a left posterior frontal lobe hematoma with a small amount of adjacent associated subarachnoid hemorrhage likely due to amyloid angiopathy however with a possibility of an underlying cavernous angioma .
Otherwise , the MRI of the brain was unremarkable and there was mild atherosclerotic plaque at the origin of the right internal carotid artery with an otherwise unremarkable extracranial and intracranial MRA .
The patient was also evaluated by the Neurosurgical Service who did not see any need for intervention secondary to the small size and the minimal dysfunction that the patient had .
The patient subsequently underwent a stroke workup by the Stroke Neurology Team and this was including a transthoracic echocardiogram , which showed a normal left ventricular size and function with normal left ventricular segmental function and an ejection fraction of 55% to 60% .
There was mild aortic and mild tricuspid regurgitation .

Chief Complaint :
respiratory distress , hemoptysis transferred from OSH
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
debridement of mass from tracheal lumen by interventional pulmonary
History of Present Illness :
95 yo male with PMH large right thyroid cystic mass eroding into trachea , who presented to St. Anne 's Hospital 2018-04-22 with hemoptysis and respiratory distress , now diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma .
.
Pt reports that he noticed a right neck mass last October .
The mass grew larger , to the size of a baseball .
It appears that FNA was performed but was non-diagnostic ( probably because anaplastic tumors tend to be necrotic ) .
The mass appears to be cystic in nature and has been aspirated at least 3 times , which decrease in size each time .
Now size is 6.5cm*6.5cm .
Plan for surgery in Oct was deferred 04-05 syncope and pacer placement for SSS; again deferred 2 weeks ago 04-05 URI; was planned for surgery this Thurday .
.
Pt was o/w in his USOH until 2-3 weeks ago when he developed a URI with symptoms of dry cough; no fever , chills , sore throat , myalgias .
Pt was treated with 3 days of an antibiotics , followed by a 10 day course of levaquin ( completed 2 days PTA ) .
Per pt and son , no James pna .
2 days prior to admission , pt developed hemoptysis; states he coughed up 4 tsp of blood .
1 day PTA , pt developed stridorous breathing and respiratory distress .
Pt was initially seen at Lahey North , where he was given steroids , with improvement in respiratory status .
Pt was transferred to New England Baptist Hospital , where his surgeon is located .
There he was admitted to the CMED .
Thyroid cyst was aspirated with removal of 300cc of fluid . 
Pt was given racemic epinephrine and Decadron 10mg IV x1. CT neck showed tracheal mass per nursing s/o ( pt brought CT ) .
.
Pt now breathing more comfortably .
He has not had fever and night sweats but reports weakness and weight loss for several months recently .

Pertinent Results :
CT Neck - IMPRESSION :
1. 7-cm diameter right neck mass , with direct invasion of the subglottic , cervical and proximal thoracic trachea .
The mass is reportedly thyroid in origin .
Differential diagnosis includes primary head/neck cancer and lymphoma .
2. Left lobe thyroid enlargement with heterogeneous appearance .
3. Right upper paratracheal and prevascular lymphadenopathy as well as additional nodes in the right side of the neck .
Dedicated MR of the neck may be helpful for more complete assessment of the neck mass and lymphadenopathy if warranted clinically .
.
Pathology :
The tumor is composed of a relatively monotonous proliferation of spindle cells which grow in sheets with a prominent vascular pattern .
Immunostains for cytokeratin AE1/3 and CAM 5.2 , CD-68 , CD-79a , CD-138 , S-100 , LCA absorbed CEA , EMA , CD34 , CD31 , TTF-1 , actin , desmin , MNF-116 , calcitonin , and thyroglobulin are negative .
These results exclude both melanoma and hematopoietic neoplasms .
The differential diagnosis includes , but is not limited to , sarcoma , spindle cell carcinomas ( sarcomatoid carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ) , and malignant salivary gland neoplasms .
Brief Hospital Course :
Pt was transferred here for further mgmt of airway and large thyroid mass by our IP team .
IP found endotracheal obstructing tumor and extrinsic compression of the high trachea by thyroid mass .
After rigid bronchoscopy with removal of the intratracheal tumor component on 2018-04-24 , stat pathology showed anaplastic tumor .
He was tranferred to the CMED .
Subsequently extubated and his respiratory Sx are now improved .
Pt was seen by Rad Onc , who recommended transfer to the East Campus for XRT .
On the morning of possible radiation , patient and family met with interventional pulmonary team who explained that the most recent CT showed further invasion of the tumor into the trachea .
After a long discussion , patient and family asked to be made CMO .
Patient was started on morphine drip and palliative care team was consulted with recommendations to ensure comfort .
Mr . Davison died approximately 24 hours after decision to be CMO , on 2018-05-01 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 37-year-old female who presents on an elective basis for a living-related kidney transplant .
The patient has a history of end-stage renal failure secondary to type 1 diabetes with a baseline creatinine of around 5 .
She is receiving a kidney from her sister .
The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , and insulin-dependent diabetes for 32 years .
She is status post myocardial infarction in April of this year and subsequently underwent coronary artery bypass surgery .
She present electively on the morning of her surgery with no recent changes in her medical problems .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Sarcoidosis since 2001 .
2. She is status post cholecystectomy .
3. Status post tubal ligation .
4. Status post left arteriovenous graft placement for hemodialysis .
5. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus times 32 years .
6. Hypertension .
7. Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction in 2012-05-06 .
8. End-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis for 1.5 years .
ALLERGIES :
Allergies include AMOXICILLIN and CODEINE .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Insulin by sliding-scale , NPH insulin 16 units in the morning and 6 units in the evening .
2. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Zoloft 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. Reglan 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Multivitamin 1 p.o. q.d.
8. Remeron p.o. q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a half to one pack per day smoker for 10 years who quit approximately one week prior to her admission .
She denies alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
Physical examination at the time of admission revealed she was in no acute distress .
Blood pressure was 150/79 , a pulse of 81 .
She is legally blind .
She was without any adenopathy .
Her chest was clear to auscultation .
Heart had a normal S1 and S2 , with no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Her abdomen was soft with well-healed incisions .
There was no organomegaly .
Extremities were without edema .
She had a functioning arteriovenous fistula with a thrill and a bruit in her left arm .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area and taken electively to the operating room .
She underwent a living-related renal transplant in the right iliac fossa .
The operation was somewhat technically difficult secondary to a short segment of ureter which was anastomosed over a stent to the bladder .
Otherwise , there were difficulties , and estimated blood loss was minimal .
She was taken postoperatively to the recovery room already making a large amount of urine .
Intraoperatively , for immunosuppression she received thymoglobulin and Solu-Medrol .
She was started on Prograf and CellCept in the postoperative period .
She was also maintained on Bactrim postoperatively and did not require ganciclovir , as she and her sister were cytomegalovirus negative .
The patient 's initial postoperative course was relatively uneventful .
Her creatinine , which was 5 initially postoperatively , slowly dropped over the next few days until eventually reaching a low of 1 .
She did receive pamidronate on postoperative day one and received a total of four doses thymoglobulin .
Her steroid doses were slowly tapered over her hospital course , and her Prograf level was adjusted to maintain therapeutic values between 10 and 15 .
She continued to make good urine over the first few days and had her urine losses replaced with intravenous fluids .
On postoperative day three , the patient had an episode of shortness of breath that was evaluated by both the Renal and surgical residents .
It was found that she was in acute pulmonary edema and required transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
Her blood pressure at the time of this incident was in the range of 200/120 .
Her electrocardiogram showed no specific ST changes , but there was some loss of her R wave progression laterally .
Serial enzymes were drawn , and Cardiology was consulted .
With blood pressure control via a nitroglycerin drip and fluid restriction , the patient quickly improved and a had a relatively short stay in the Intensive Care Unit .
Throughout this time , her creatinine continued to drop , and there was no apparent deleterious effect on her transplant from this episode .
Her beta blocker was progressively increased , and her nitroglycerin drip was weaned down .
Two days after this event , she underwent an echocardiogram which was significant for slightly depressed left ventricular systolic function with severe posterior wall hypokinesis .
This was a change from her prior echocardiogram and demonstrated evidence of a small myocardial infarction .
Clinically , she did much better and her blood pressure was optimized prior to discharge .
She was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day five and was stable on the floor for the next two days .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
She was set to be discharged to home on 11-28 , on postoperative day seven .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Prograf 4 mg p.o. b.i.d. ( this may change depending on her most recent Prograf level which will be drawn on the morning of 11-28 ) .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .
The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
On admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .
Her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , HDL32 , LDL 64 .
The patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .
It was unclear whether this was old or new .
A TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
Chest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .
The patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .
The cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .
Her blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .
She will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She is on an aspirin .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;
Pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .
Unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin .
An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .
Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .
She has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence .
She has episodes of not breathing .
BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
4. Hematology :
D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .
This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
It was a poor study .
Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Discharge INR 1.8 .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :
Low salt diet .
Low cholesterol , low fat diet .
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE :
To rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
House diet .
No added salt .
Low saturated fat .
Low cholesterol .
ACTIVITY :
As tolerated .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
The patient needs physical therapy to increase stability in mobilization .
Need to try to control blood pressure .
Can increase her Ace inhibitor as tolerated .
May start beta-blocker at a low dose given mild bradycardia at atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day .
Need to continue oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula .
Needs anticoagulation for 6 months for right common femoral artery deep venous thrombosis .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
Should continue Keflex for 10 more days or as clinically indicated .
Need to follow INR after Keflex is discontinued as expect it will change .
The patient has severe sleep apnea and stops breathing during sleep .
This is her baseline status .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Satisfactory .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4-6 hours p.r.n. headache , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day , calcium gluconate 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enema of choice and laxative of choice p.o. q day p.r.n. constipation , Lasix 20 mg p.o. q day , Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o.q.h.s. for goal INR of 2.0-3.0 .
Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. x 10 more days , Miconazole 2% powder topically b.i.d. apply to affected areas of breasts and groins b.i.d. , Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q day hold of systolic blood pressure less than 110 , Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously q 12 hours x 2 doses and then discontinued , atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q day hold for a systolic blood pressure of less than 110 , heart rate less than 55 .

PROGRESS :
The patient continued to have hypertensive emergency over the next several days .
He also had acute chronic renal failure that worsened .
There was some concern for possible acute myocardial infarction but the troponin was felt to be elevated because of his chronic renal disease .
The patient slowly and gradually improved with regard to his blood pressure and output over the next several days .
He had diffuse edema which eventually came down .
We continued to monitor CPK since it was elevated and there was a concern for rhabdomyolysis .
The patient slowly improved over the next several days and the blood pressure came down gradually as did the peripheral edema .
He did have significant venous stasis with peripheral edema and was started on Tubigrip stockings .

Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was taken to the operating room on 2018-12-04 for TVH , sacrospinous fixation , SPARC , anterior and posterior repair with mesh , cystoscopy; for pelvic organ prolapse .
There were no intraoperative complications and the surgical field was hemostatic at the conclusion of the case ( see operative report for full description ) .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable in the PACU and admitted to the CMED CCU floor for routine care .
At 1645 12-04 , the patient was noted to be hypotensive to 70/40
HR 84 with symptoms of lightheadedness while lying supine .
There was no active bleeding noted at the surgical site on examination .
A STAT HCT drawn at this time was 31.2 .
The patient was re-evalutated at 2000 and was found to be tacchycardic to 115 with BP 104/50 using a manual cuff .
Urine output during the prior two hours had been 50cc and 24cc .
A STAT HCT drawn at this time was 19.5 .
The clinical picture was concerning for a post-operative hematoma .
The ICU was alerted to the patient 's disposition and the operating room was activated for urgent re-exploration .
The patient was taken to the OR on POD#0 for re-exploration with incision at 2243 .
Exploratory laparotomy revealed hemoperitonium and approximately 1 L of blood was evacuated .
There was approximately 500cc of retroperitoneal clot .
Despite laparotomy and re-exploration through the vaginal cuff , no source for the bleeding could be found .
At the conclusion of the case , the patient continued to bleed , allbeit at a less brisk pace .
The endotracheal tube was left in place .
Intraoperatively , the patient recieved 5u PRBC .
IR was consulted to identify the bleeding vessel with angiography , then perform embolization .
Tagged cell and angiographic studies performed immediately after re-exploration on 12-05 did not indetify active bleeding and no emobolization was indicated .
THe patient was stable and remained intubated .
The patient was admitted to the ICU for further care .
The patient 's ICU course was uneventful .
There was no evidence of continued bleeding and her HCT remained stable around 30 .
The pt self-extubated on POD #1 .
The patient developed a low grade fever to 100.1 on POD#1 which persisted to POD#2 and imperic treatment with gent/clinda was started .
The patient was stable for transfer to the CMED floor on POD#3 .
Antibiotics were discontinued on POD#8 and pt remained afebrile thereafter .
On POD#9 , the patient was afebrile , tolerating a regular diet , ambultating without difficulty and voiding spontaneously .
She was discharged home with follow-up in two weeks .

10 ) Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q. day .
11 ) Epogen q. two weeks .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Negative for tobacco , negative for alcohol .
The patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .
The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .
The patient &apos;s Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .
The patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .
At this time , the patient &apos;s presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .
2 ) Neurological / vascular :
The discrepancy in the patient &apos;s pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .
The patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .
The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .
The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .
MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .
The patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .
The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .
The results of these studies suggested that the patient &apos;s symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .
A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient &apos;s intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .
3 ) Orthopedic :
The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .
Outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .
Repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .
An Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance .
A bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .
At the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .
Plans were made for the patient to be discharged to Dwardmegriff Rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .
4 ) Gastrointestinal :
The patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .
The patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .
The patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .
However , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .
The patient &apos;s emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .
The etiology of the patient &apos;s nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .
The patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .
An attempt was also made to reduce the patient &apos;s large number of medications and the patient &apos;s Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .
5 ) Infectious disease :
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .
Urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .
The patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .
The urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .
6 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient had a mild increase in her BUN and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids .
The patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Dec 20 07]
I saw the patient on round with the ICU Team .
I interviewed and examined the patient .
I reviewed his data on EMTEK including vital signs , I 's and O 's , laboratory data , and medication list .
I discussed the management plan with the Critical Care Team after reviewing the House Staff note .
The patient is a **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male with a history of severe gallstone pancreatitis with abdominal abscess formation and also with SMA aneurysm status post repair with PTFE graft with ongoing respiratory failure .
Overnight , the patient had some hypertension and it appeared that tube feeds were being drained from his G tube .
These are tube feeds going through the patient 's J tube .
The patient is afebrile .
Heart rate in the 80 's , his mean arterial pressure in the 90 's to 110 .
His pressure went as high as 190/88 .
He is on assist control ventilation breathing with the ventilator at 20 , tidal volume of 450 , 50% FiO2 and PEEP of 5 .
I 's and O 's 3.1 liters in and 2.9 liters out .
His urine output was 1 liter .
His NG drained 450 mL and it does appear to have tube feeds in the drainage .
He is on Oxepa tube feeds at 40 mL / hour .
Laboratory data is significant for a sodium of 133 , potassium 3.4 .
His BUN and creatinine are 24 and 0.9 .
His white blood count is 4.9 , hemoglobin is 9.7 and it was 10.2 the previous day , platelets are unchanged at 152 .
His magnesium is low at 1.1 .
His INR is 1.4 .
His total bilirubin is 1.6 .
His chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates and edema , but overall slightly improved .
The patient is sedated and denies pain .
He can answer simple questions .
He has some rhonchi bilaterally .
Abdomen is distended and soft .
His wound where the skin is left open and packed is clean .
His PTC drainage is bilious .
From a respiratory standpoint , I am going to decrease the patient 's set ventilatory rate to 10 and wean his FiO2 as tolerated down to 40% .
If he is breathing over the ventilator and maintaining good minute ventilation , we will try CPAP pressure support trials .
In order to do this , I am going to decrease his Fentanyl infusion from 200 to 100 mcg / hour .
The patient is on a heparin drip at 900 units / hour which we are maintaining at this level for his
SMA aneurysm per Vascular Surgery .
From a cardiovascular standpoint , also because of his hypertension , I am going to increase his Lopressor .
We may need to add a second agent for blood pressure control .
He is also receiving p.r.n. labetalol .
From a GI / nutrition standpoint , the patient had evacuation of abdominal abscesses related to his severe pancreatitis with drains in place .
I am going to check an abdominal x-ray .
The patient is being fed through the J port of his GJ tube , but it appears that tube feeds are coming out of the G tube .
I am going to check the x-ray for tube position .
I am going to drop his tube feeds down to 20 mL / hour .
The patient 's electrolytes are being repleted .
He is on linezolid and meropenem day 5 for his pancreatitis - related abdominal abscesses .
He is on his home medications of olanzapine for bipolar disorder as well as Remeron and Wellbutrin .
I am continuing his Pepcid for GI prophylaxis .
Critical care time is 31 minutes .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY NAME :
RIEFF , ALB P
UNIT NUMBER :
185-64-30
ADMISSION DATE :
08/24/1998
DISCHARGE DATE :
09/14/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Sternal wound infection .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Infected aortic graft .
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
08/31/98 ascending aortic root replacement with homograft with omentopexy .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
09/02/98 sternal debridement .
Bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap .
Right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap .
Primary closure of wound .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection .
At that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap .
The patient was then continued by report on Dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation .
The patient apparently did well until June 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area .
A ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired .
The patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired .
However the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma .
By report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital .
However the patient was then subsequently transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention .
The patient was evaluated by Dr. Rhalt of Dentvailr. Medical Center .
As the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .
There was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .
At the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .
Subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .
Given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .
The patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .
The patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .
He did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Thoracic aneurysm repair .
2. Hypertension .
3. Status post hernia repair .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .
2. Captopril 75 mg po three times a day .
3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .

5. Reglan 10 mg po three times a day .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable .
Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam :
negative .
Neck was supple .
There was no jugular venous distention .
2+ carotids without bruits .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles .
Extremities :
the patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 .
The patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .
Over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .
The patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .
The patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .
After lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .
This was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .
The patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .
The procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .
The aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .
The cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .
The graft used was a homograft .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .
The immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
There he continued to be hemodynamically stable .
Of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .
In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .
On that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .
A number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .
The patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
At this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .
The Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .
Over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .
The patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .
The patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .
Subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .
The patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .
As per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .
However on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .
Given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .
The patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .
This was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .
At the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .
He was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .
He continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .
On postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .
Subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .
The patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .
The patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .
These drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .
Prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
The patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .
As a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .
The patient 's condition continued to be improved .
Given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .
In consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
Diet :
High calorie , high protein .
The patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .
The patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
The patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger .
The patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term Vancomycin therapy .
The patient was instructed to return to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain .
The patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h.
2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po per day .
3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .
4. Captopril 100 mg po three times a day .
5. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .
6. Albuterol nebulizers q6h as needed .
7. Atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed .
8. Lasix 20 mg po per day .
9. Kay-Ciel 20 mEq po per day .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient was instructed that he needed to followup with Dr. Rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in Oaksale Lavalle .
The patient was also instructed to followup with Dr. Both of the Cardiology Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted .
The patient will also be seen in followup by Dr. Chpo E. Enla General of the Plastic Surgery Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital so that his indwelling Jackson Pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him .
The patient will also be followed by the Infectious Disease Service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy .
The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. Naco Mesprhalt of the Infectious Disease Service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge .
Dr. Dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression .

2016-05-11 MRI head:
FINDINGS :
The sagittal T1 images demonstrate several areas of high signal along the sulci bilaterally which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhages .
There are several areas of hyperintensities at the convexity which could be intraaxial and could be related to hemorrhage within the metastatic lesions but in absence of gradient echo images , this could not be further confirmed .
A CT would help for further assessment if indicated .
There is increased signal seen in both basal ganglia region as well as along the rolandic region bilaterally which is suggestive of global hypoxic injury to the brain .
There are several areas of brain edema identified in the left frontal and parietal lobe and both temporal lobes , which are suspicious for areas of metastatic disease with surrounding edema .
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift seen .
No herniation is identified .
Images through the skull base demonstrate soft tissue changes in the sphenoid sinus which could be due to retained secretions from intubation .
There is increased signal seen along the sulci on FLAIR images at the convexity which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage .
A CT would help for further assessment and exclude proteinaceous material within the sulci .
Gadolinium-enhanced MRI would also help for further assessment .
.
pCXR 2016-05-11 5:01am:
FINDINGS :
No prior comparisons .
Tip of the ETT projects roughly 5 cm above the carina .
A right IJ central venous line is at the level of the mid SVC .
Tip of the NGT is below the edge of the image .
IVC filter and probable NU stent catheter on the left also noted .
Heart and mediastinum are unremarkable allowing for technique , no sizeable pneumothorax .
There is a somewhat wedge-shaped opacity at the right lung base which could represent aspiration or pneumonia .
No other confluent infiltrates are appreciated
.
pCXR 2016-05-11. 1:46pm:
1. Mild pulmonary edema .
2. Vague right lower lobe opacity most likely represents pulmonary edema though if opacity persistent after diuresis , aspiration and pneumonia will become considerations .
3. ETT 4 cm above the carina with NG tube advancement into the stomach .
.
EEG 2016-05-12:
Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing .
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy .
Medications , metabolic disturbances , and infection are among the most common causes .
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is another possible explanation .
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing , and there were no epileptiform features
.
Trans-thoracic echocardiogram 2016-05-12 :
The left atrium is normal in size .
Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and systolic function are normal ( LVEF>55% ) .
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal .
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation .
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation .
There is no mitral valve prolapse .
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined .
There is no pericardial effusion .
IMPRESSION :
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function .
No pericardial effusion .
.
pCXR 2016-05-13 :
Mild left lower perihilar opacification has improved , probably resolving edema .
There is more rightward mediastinal shift , suggesting new atelectasis in the right lung .
Enlargement of the right hilus could represent adenopathy .
Whether to pursue this would depend upon clinical circumstances .
Heart size normal .
ET tube in standard placement .
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view .
No appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusions
.
pCXR 2016-05-14 :
Increasing opacification of the lungs could be due to mild pulmonary edema and multiple micrometastases , worsened slightly since 05-13 at 10:57 p.m.
Heart size is normal .
There is no pleural effusion .
The ET tube and right PICC line in standard placements .
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view .
No pneumothorax .

Brief Hospital Course :
30 yo F with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary who presented to OSH 04-25 with pseudomonal urosepsis , vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation .
Course complicated by sub arachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds as well as potential hypotensive brain injury with poor prognosis per neurology .
Transferred here for second opinion on poor prognosis .
.
# Neurologic - The patient was seen by the Neurology consult service and underwent MRI head which revealed lesions suspicious for metastases , possible hemorrhages , and findings consistent with hypoxic brain injury .
EEG was performed and revealed encephalopathy .
The patient 's neurologic exam ( performed after sedation removed >48 hours ) revealed intact brainstem function without evidence of higher cortical activity .
She had some metabolic abnormalities which were corrected ( hypernatremia , hyperphosphatemia ) , but neurologic exam was unchanged .
A family meeting on 2016-05-13 was held and these findings communicated with the patient 's family .
Final neurologic assessment was that the patient was unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic functioning .
At the request of her family , she will be transferred closer to her home in Wyoming , to Women and
Infants hospital .
.
# Respiratory Failure - Pt arrived on pressure support ventilation , which was changed to Assist control to make patient more comfortable .
She was originally intubated for airway protection , and it is felt she could likely be weaned from the ventilator although she would be extremely high risk for aspiration .
Due to family request to move patient to a hospital closer to home , she will remain intubated until transfer , with plan to extubate upon arrival to Women and Infants hospital with initiation of full palliative care and compliance of DNI status .
.
# Fevers/Infection - Per outside hospital records , the patient grew pseudomonas from blood and urine .
At OSH , she was treated with 7 days of vancomycin , as well as 13 days ( of 14-day planned course ) of Ciprofloxacin and Zosyn .
She was intially continued on Cipro/Zosyn .
CXR 05-11 revealed ? pneumonia vs atelectasis at the R lung base .
Continues to spike fever .
Could have still seeding of nephrostomy tube .
Urology at OSH against pulling tube because coagulopathy and may not be able to replace .
Fevers also may be from head bleed , cancer , or drug .
She was continued on zosyn and vancomycin to complete a >14 day course .
She continued to have fevers .
Antibiotics were discontinued on 05-15 .
No further infectious course was identified and the fevers may have been due to underlying malignant process .
.
# Squamous Cell Cancer - unknown primary .
The patient was seen by the oncology consult service who contacted her outside hematologist Dr. Pauling .
Upon discussion with him it was noted that the patient had progression of her disease after systemic therapy with topotecan and cisplatin .
She then proceed to XRT with cisplatin which she was unable to tolerate this secondary to thrombocytopenia ( 40-50K ) .
Given this we were unable to offer her additional therapy. Hematology/Oncology service at Mediplex Rehab Hospital confirmed her grim prognosis and expective survival in terms of weeks to months with no further available treatment .
.
# h/o DVT - patient with head bleed which is contraindication to anti-coagulation .
IVC filter in place .
Patient was on pneumoboots while in hospital .
.
# Hypernatremia - Improved from OSH .
Total body volume overloaded .
Water Deficit 2.5 L .
She was continued on free H20 boluses and D5 1/2 NS and corrected .
.
# Acute Renal Failure - stable , likely 02-12 hypotension leading to ATN that is slowly improving .
.
# Access - R IJ changed sterilly over wire 05-01
.
# FEN - tube feeds are held in route in anticipation of extubation .
.
.
# Code Status :
After multiple discussion with family and the doctor accepting the patient at Women and Infants Hospital(  Dr . Pauling ) at RI .
She was made DNR/DNI and the plan is that she will be transferred to WIH and extubated there upon arrival with initiation of full palliative care .
The family understood this; all questions were answered and they wished to proceed .
They understand that there is no ICU at WIH and no further advanced pulmonary support can be offered .

Chest x-ray was low lung volumes , no consolidation .
EKG showed sinus brady at 16 , normal axis , normal intervals , no STT wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Team Four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for MI .
Hospital course by system :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .
The patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .
The next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .
This echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .
However , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .
It was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .
The patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .
This responded to fluid bolus .
The patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .
The patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .
This stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 &apos;s or 70 &apos;s was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .
Clearly , the patient &apos;s hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .
2. Infectious Disease :
On hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .
The next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .
She continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .
She was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .
Her urine legionella antigen was negative .
On 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .
She was started on vancomycin for this .
These bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .
She had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .
3. GI :
The patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .
GI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .
Finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .
The EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .
Her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .
4. Shortness of breath :
As mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .
At most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .
This was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .
5. Derm :
Several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .
She was started on some Miconazole Cream .
The rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .
The rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tums , 500-1250 mg PO tid .
Albuterol inhaler .
Lipitor , 20 daily .
Prozac , 60 daily .
Flovent inhaler , 220 mcg bid .
Atrovent , two puffs qid .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Shortness of breath .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 71-year-old-female with asthma and a history of recent exacerbation of lower extremity edema who , at her baseline , gets short of breath walking across the room and sleeps on four pillows times several years .
She has reported that she has had upper respiratory symptoms times several days with increasing dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath , eventually at rest with marked wheezing .
She also has a cough with a small amount of white sputum .
At 3 a.m. on the day of admission , she became much worse and after several days of increasing her meter-dosed inhaler use , she call Emergency Medical Services which assessed her as having heart failure with elevated jugular venous distention and rales .
She received aspirin , Lasix 40 mg intravenously times two , 0.8 mg of nitroglycerin times four , plus morphine sulfate .
Her blood pressure was noted to be up to 220/110 .
She was taken to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Emergency Room where she was assessed as having asthma .
She then received continuous nebulizer treatments for approximately eight hours with minimal improvement .
She did receive intravenous nitroglycerin in the Emergency Room for blood pressure controlled to the 170s .
She initially received a treatment of BiPAP on arrival as she was barely able to speak .
She also received 80 mg of Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department .
She was never hypoxic but initially her arterial blood gas showed a respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 of 71 .
The patient does have a vague history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , but this is felt to be inaccurate .
She also received captopril 12.5 mg times one .
Recently , the patient has been treated with several steroid tapers .
Depending on the family , patient , and the OMR records , the exact duration of the most recent one was unclear .
It either ended in 2011-04-11 or continued through 2011-05-11 with use of Augmentin ; and , by report , lasted until 06-07 .
However , the family said the patient has been on steroids for several weeks .
The patient denies any exposure to smoke , animals , unusual dust or vapors , or other asthma triggers .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Asthma as a child which recurred in 2001 .
She takes an albuterol and Atrovent inhalers as well as Serevent and Flovent .
She has had multiple hospitalizations and has never been intubated .
She has had multiple prednisone tapers ( see History of Present Illness ) .
On prednisone or sometime after it was discontinued , depending on the version , the patient developed worsening lower extremity edema which has been a Vega problem for her and was started on dyazide as an outpatient .
Pulmonary function tests most recently in 2009-01-10 were not obstructive .
They showed an FVC of 91% of predicted , and a FEV1 of 104% of predicted , with a ratio of 114% .
In 2003 , there was 19% change of the FEV1 and an 11% change in the FVC with bronchodilators .
2. Mild hypertension , especially on prednisone .
3. Hypoplastic left lower extremity and hip repair at the age of five .
4. Polio .
5. Status post cesarean section .
6. History of zoster .
7. Past Discharge Summary mention a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , but the patient has never smoked .
8. Incontinent of both stool and urine .
9. Allergic rhinitis .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Brother and sister both have asthma .
Brother has diabetes mellitus .
There is no family history of coronary artery disease .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives on the first floor of her home with her daughter living upstairs .
There are several foster children also in the home that take care of her at times .
She has never smoked and does not drink .
She does not use drugs .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Dyazide 25/37.5 p.o. q.d. , as well as Atrovent , albuterol , and Flovent inhalers , and Swanson 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and Serevent 2 puffs q.12h.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
On transfer , she also arrived on 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and reports p.r.n. Alka-Seltzer , sinus and NyQuil use .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Review of systems were notable for lower extremity edema which worsened in May .
She says she has had this intermittently with hot summers in the past .
She denies chest pain .
She does have chest tightness since two days ago , coinciding with her wheezing .
She had paroxysms of cough and shortness of breath which resolves with water and sitting up .
This is worse when she has asthma flares .
She denies a rash and any genitourinary symptoms .
She has had a constant runny nose and has had no sick contacts .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
Physical examination revealed afebrile , respiratory rate of 23 , heart rate of 113 , blood pressure 130s/90s .
In general , this was a female in moderate distress secondary to shortness of breath , spoke in short phrases and then in complete sentences as the night went on .
Head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat revealed oropharynx was moist .
There was no jugular venous distention .
There was no HDR .
Sclerae were anicteric .
Cardiovascular revealed she was tachycardic with a regular first heart sound and second heart sound .
Pulmonary revealed she had diffuse wheezes .
There were no rales .
She had reduced but adequate air movement .
The abdomen revealed normal active bowel sounds , soft , nontender , obese , and nondistended .
Extremities revealed left lower extremity was hypoplastic .
There was pitting edema on both sides of the lower extremities .
The right ankle was somewhat tender from this edema .
Neurologically , the patient was oriented to person , place , and time ; however , she was somewhat drowsy and at times was difficult to keep awake during conversations .
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION :
White blood cell count was 10.2 , hematocrit of 37.5 , platelets of 236 .
INR of 1.3 , PTT of 30.3 .
Urinalysis revealed 6 to 10 red blood cells , 0 to 2 white blood cells , 4 epithelial cells with Foley in place .
Urine culture later grew out contaminated specimen .
Differential with 72 polys , 16 lymphocytes , 4.6 monocytes , 6.3 eosinophils .
Chem-7 was notable for a bicarbonate of 31 and a glucose of 156 .
Arterial blood gas was 7.24/71/227 .
Creatine kinase was 243 , with a MB of 9 , and a troponin of less than 0.3.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING :
Chest x-ray showed low lung volumes but no evidence of congestive heart failure .
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 115 with a normal axis , intermittent Q wave in III; a wavy baseline .
The patient had a stress echocardiogram with a normal ejection fraction in 2007 .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. PULMONARY :
She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent continuous nebulizers and was weaned then to intermittent nebulizer treatments and then to her meter-dosed inhalers taking them q.4h. at the time of discharge .
She was continued on salmeterol and Flovent .
She was continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h. then converted to prednisone at 60 mg p.o. q.d.
She was started on Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed .
Her PCO2 gradually declined to the 48 range .
Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department , she never became more hypercarbic , and her PCO2 trended to 48 by the time the arterial line was discontinued .
On the night of admission and thereafter , she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep .
This would disappear whenever she was awake .
Her case was discussed with Ear/Nose/Throat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending .
She was given a trial of 80/20 mixed helium/oxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect .
Ear/Nose/Throat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake .
The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial creatine kinases , although these did rise to 816 .
MB was negative .
She was treated with captopril for hypertension , and this was switched to Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. on discharge .
She had an echocardiogram which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular of normal thickness and size , and no significant valvular disease .
She apparently did not have a cardiovascular component to her wheezing or shortness of breath ; however , she was to go home on Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. to help with lower extremity edema , as she experiences discomfort with this , and the team felt this may be a limiting factor with her prednisone compliance .
3. ENDOCRINE :
She was treated with a sliding-scale of regular insulin while she was in house .
She was given 500 mg p.o. q.d. of metformin to treat her steroid-induced diabetes on discharge .
This should be followed up by her primary care physician .
4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
She was treated briefly with levofloxacin because of the gram-positive cocci in her sputum culture ; however , her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection , and levofloxacin was continued at the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Combivent meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. weaning to albuterol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h.
3. Salmeterol 2 puffs q.12h.
4. Flovent 220 mcg 2 puffs q.12h.
5. Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d. with taper .
6. Fentress 60 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Univasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
Dyazide was discontinued .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
Discharge services included visiting nursing which was to assess in her inhaler technique , monitor her fasting blood sugars , as well as her blood pressure , monitor her peak flows , and assess her mobility and activities of daily living at home .
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP :
She was also to seek the next available appointment with Dr. Jeanette Barr or to see another resident in the Saint Vincent Hospital Clinic if she cannot get an appointment within one week .
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :
Condition on discharge was good ..
CODE STATUS :
Full code .

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Chest pain :
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction .
However , with her history of disease , patient underwent a cardiac catheterization .
The patient was found at cardiac catheterization to have mild diffuse instent restenosis in the mid stent , otherwise hemodynamically normal and the coronary arteries otherwise were without flow-limiting stenoses .
The patient was then continued on her cardiac medications .
It was felt that if we attempted aspirin desensitize her while an inpatient , then she would benefit from the use of aspirin and Plavix .
The patient was sent to the CCU and underwent aspirin desensitization protocol , which she tolerated well .
She had mild worsening of her asthma attacks , which was relieved by Benadryl and occasionally albuterol .
The patient found that if she took the aspirin in the evening with her Benadryl that she takes for sleep , that the asthma exacerbation did not occur .
Aspirin no longer should be considered an allergy for this patient , and she is going to take this as an outpatient .

Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
06/12/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
1) EXTENSIVE POSTERIOR CIRCULATION INFARCTION .
2) ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 82 year-old right handed gentleman who has a past medical history of hypertension and tobacco use presented to the emergency room with acute change in mental status .
He was well until the evening prior to presentation to the emergency room when he complained of headache across the forehead .
On the day of presentation , he was then found by his daughter lying on his bed groaning , being relatively unresponsive and unable to speak .
The family reported one episode of vomiting at home .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 158/53 , respiratory rate 16-20 , oxygen saturation 97% on three liters .
General :
The patient was somnolent , breathing comfortably , occasionally coughing .
Neck was supple with full range of motion .
No bruits were heard .
Chest was clear to auscultation but with poor air entry .
Heart sounds were regular with one out of six holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Abdomen was soft , non-tender , bowel sounds present .
Extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Neurological examination revealed a patient who was intermittently alert , opening eyes to voice , following simple commands , but without any speech .
Pupils were 4 mm reactive to 2 mm bilaterally .
There was no pupillary defect .
Dolls eye was negative .
There was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes .
Corneals were present bilaterally .
Gag was present weakly .
Face was symmetrical .
Tongue was midline .
The patient was moving the right side spontaneously , but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time .
There was only minimal movement on the left side .
On sensory testing , the patient withdrew all extremities to pain .
Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over .
The left toe was upgoing , the right toe was downgoing .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 151 .
AST was 20 , ALT 12 , alkaline phosphatase 80 , bilirubin 0.5. CK was 113 .
Thyroid function tests were normal .
Troponin I was 0.05 .
Total protein was 8 , albumin 4.3 , globulin 3.7 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 2.7 , magnesium 2.0. White blood cell count was 7 , hemoglobin 14.1 , hematocrit 43.6 , platelet count 241 .
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 .
PT was 12.3 , PTT 27.1. An EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 53 with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic T-waves in V1 to V3 without any acute changes .
A chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation .
The head CT scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin .
Around 4:00 AM the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted .
Lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout .
Neurologically , the patient was not following commands .
Eyes were closed .
He was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before .
Withdrawal to pain was still present .
Both plantars were upgoing .
A blood gas at this point showed a pH of 7.49 , pO2 61 , pCO2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia .
The patient &apos;s temperature was 102 degrees .
A repeat CAT scan of the head was performed .
This showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere .
There was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage .
At this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .
An MRI and MRA of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation .
The MRI showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons .
The MRA of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries .
The left vertebral artery was not visualized .
There was a dominant right vertebral artery .
There was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left .
There was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries .
Clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate .
Neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation .
The patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management .
Heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage .
The aspiration pneumonia was treated with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole .
The patient &apos;s family was involved and they decided to opt for DNR / DNI in view of the poor prognosis .
The patient passed away at 6:45 AM on June 12 , 1998 .

Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
01/02/1992
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS :
ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 64 year old white male with a past medical history of smoking , coronary artery disese , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia with a l0 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm .
Patient presented to his private medical doctor in Gewestster with transient calf pain on walking less than fifty yards .
Abdominal aortic aneurysm was discovered on examination and patient was referred to Retelk County Medical Center .
He was admitted on 10/17/06 and echocardiogram done on 11/13/09 revealed poor left ventricular function and cardiac catheterization was done on admission which showed three vessel disease .
Patient was referred to Cardiology and underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 11/25/09 .
His post-operative course was complicated by an E. coli urinary tract infection and transient acute renal failure with increasing creatinine .
Patient &apos;s renal function returned to normal over several days , however .
The patient &apos;s last ultrasound of his aorta revealed a l0 cm aneurysm and he presented at the time of admission for an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
Myocardial infarction also in l983 and l988 , congestive heart failure in l989 , diverticulitis in l978 , and spontaneous pneumothorax in l956 .
He had a coronary artery bypass graft times three as mentioned above .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
He came in on Carafate , Enteric Coated Aspirin , Albuterol Inhaler , Atrovent Inhaler , Procan SR , Mevacor , and Digoxin .
ALLERGIES :
He is allergic to Penicillin , Inderal , and also to Procan .
Patient has a seventy pack year history of smoking which he quit ten years ago and he has previously had problems with alcohol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission was remarkable for an abdomen which was soft and non-tender .
There was a pulsatile mass felt in the right upper quadrant near the midline .
He had dopplerable lower extremity pulses on the left and on the right , they were palpable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted and taken to the Operating Room the next day on 12/24/09 where patient underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
In his post-operative course , patient was sent to the unit and was put on perioperative Vancomycin .
Post-operatively , patient was found to have frequent aberrant atrial premature beats and some rare ventricular premature beats .
His lungs were found to have decreased breath sounds with a question of fluid overload .
There was a question of whether to start him on Quinidine versus beta blockers .
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with hypokinetic and akinetic areas throughout the left and right ventricle .
Patient was loaded with Quinidine and then started on a maintenance dose .
Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm once on Quinidine .
Patient was discharged from the unit on 12/30/09 and was sent to the floor .
His digoxin was found to be elevated so his Digoxin was held for four days while levels slowly came down .
Patient was restarted on Digoxin just prior to discharge .
Patient also was found to have elevated LDH , alkaline phosphatase , and amylase prior to admission .
Lipase was within normal limits .
Ultrasound was obtained of the biliary tree which demonstrated no abnormalities .
Patient was also found to have several complaints of awaking in the middle of the night with tachypnea and some bilateral chest pain associated with breathing .
Serial EKG and CK were obtained which were negative .
A chest X-Ray demonstrated some pulmonary edema .
An arterial blood gas at that time showed pO2 of 68 , saturation of 95% , a pH of 7.5l , pCO2 of 37 , a bicarbonate of 37 , and a pCO2 of 3l with a +7 base .
Patient &apos;s chest X-Ray , as mentioned above , showed pulmonary edema .
Patient was aggressively diuresed with resolution of symptoms .
DISPOSITION :
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Patient is being sent home on Ecotrin one q.d. , Digoxin 0.l25 mg every three days , Quinidine 648 mg q.a.m. and 324 mg q.p.m. and q.h.s. , Mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Carafate one gram p.o. q.i.d. , Colace l00 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , Potassium 20 mEq p.o. q.d. , and iron supplements .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Giant cell arteritis .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :
1. Hypertension .
2. Anemia of chronic disease .
**INSTITUTION ADMISSION :
This is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who presents with multiple generalized complaints of fatigue , weakness , headache , weight loss , shortness of breath , palpitations , muscle aches , numbness , and tingling who was recently hospitalized with low - grade fevers and leukocytosis for which an extensive workup was undertaken with no source or etiology of her leukocytosis or symptoms identified .
This workup included a tagged white blood cell scan , a EMG , and a PET scan .
Of note , the patient was scheduled to have an outpatient temporal artery biopsy , but failed to follow up with this appointment .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Giant cell arteritis .
The patient carried a questionable diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus for which she had not been treated recently .
Given her multiple complaints and history of vitiligo , we continued to pursue an autoimmune explanation for her constellation of symptoms .
We did obtain a Rheumatology consult who recommended temporal artery biopsy while an inpatient .
The patient underwent temporal artery biopsy on **DATE[Sep 10 2007] .
The procedure was a bilateral temporal artery biopsy and was without complications .
Pathology performed on this specimen was consistent with giant cell arteritis .
The patient was started on prednisone 30 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was scheduled for followup with Rheumatology .
2. Dizziness .
The patient continued to complain of significant dizziness , which appeared to be positional in nature .
Her symptoms and signs are most consistent with benign positional vertigo , but given Rheumatology 's assessment that she had some asymmetric sensory abnormality on exam , we evaluated the patient with MRA of the internal auditory canals which revealed nonspecific signal changes seen in the pons in the hemispheric white matter consistent with small vessel disease .
No specific evidence of intracanicular acoustic neuroma was identified .
The patient is to have followup with **INSTITUTION .
3. Hypertension .
The patient has a history of hypertension .
We will resume the patient 's home medications , which she was probably not taking and her hypertension was well controlled while an inpatient .
4. Anemia .
The patient was felt to be anemic .
It was felt that her anemia was likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease .
However , she also had some component of iron - deficiency anemia .
We did start the patient on iron supplements and counseled her that she is to have age - appropriate cancer screening .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Prednisone 30 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Actonel 35 mg p.o. q. Fridays .
3. Iron sulfate 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. Prilosec 30 mg p.o. q. day .
5. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q. day .
6. Os - Cal D 2 tablets p.o. q. day .
7. Valsartan 40 mg p.o. q. day .
8. Vicodin 1 tablet by mouth q.6 hours as needed for pain .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
1. Disposition :
The patient is discharged home .
2. Condition :
The patient 's condition is good .
3. Activity :
The patient is to resume activity as tolerated .
4. Diet :
The patient is to resume a heart healthful diet .
5. Followup :
The patient is to have followup with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] , who we will establish as the patient 's PCP .
She will have an appointment on **DATE[Sep 19 2007] , and is to call to verify the time .
The phone number will be **PHONE .
The patient will also have outpatient followup with Rheumatology .

He was watched after his initial diagnosis , but six months later he developed rapidly increasing leukocytosis and he became more symptomatic .
After treatment with three cycles of fludarabine he had 90% involvement of his intratrabecular space .
He was therefore treated with three cycles of fludarabine in combination with cytoxan .
After this therapy he achieved a protocol eligible minimal disease state .
However , he did have relative pancytopenia following this therapy .
He was taken to bone marrow harvest in 08/22 at which time insufficient cells were obtained to proceed .
He was returned previous to this admission for repeat bone marrow harvest and at that time he was given Neupogen prior to his harvest , and sufficient cells were not obtained to proceed with autologous bone marrow transplantation .
His most recent bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 5% of intratrabecular space involvement .
Recent CT scan showed no significant lymphadenopathy .
The spleen was within normal limits .

Brief Hospital Course :
47 yo F w/ h/o steroid-induced hyperglycemia , SLE w/ h/o pericarditis , transverse myelitis w/ paraplegia and neurogenic bladder s/p urostomy w/ ileal conduit , h/o ureteropelvic stone and urosepsis , and h/o RLE DVT admitted 11-29 w/ left pyelo and right 8 mm proximal ureteral stone w/ right hydro s/p perc urostomy tube to relieve right hydro .
.
## GNR sepsis:
Upon admission , pt was febrile to 101.2 with U/A consistent with UTI .
A CT abd showed 8mm obstructing stone , hydro with stranding consistent with pylonephritis .
Her presentation was thought likely due to urosepsis given h/o foul smelling urine and in setting of stone w/ hydro + pyelo by CT. The patient went to IR on 2014-11-30 given evidence of right hydronephrosis on imaging for decompression and drainage. Upon admission , she was treated with Vancomycin and Gentamycin and Flagyl .
She was started on the MUST protocol with high dose steroids as well and a goal SVO2 >70% .
She was hypoxic requiring 3L nasal cannula O2 .
She subsequently developed hypotension with SBP in the 70s .
She was transferred to the CMED where the patient was continued on the MUST protocol with goais of CVP 10-12 , SVO2 greater than 70% .
The patient was bolused with NS and did not required pressors .
On the day after admission to the CMED , the patient was noted to have small oxygen requirement with 2L NC .
Repeat imaging revealed evidence of mild pulmonary congestion which was thought to account for the patient 's mild hypoxia .
Given that the patient had been maintaining a MAP of 60 without fluids or pressors , her goal CVP was decreased to >8 to avoid fluid overload .
The patient was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamycin while speciation and sensitivities were pending .
Ciprofloxacin was added on 2014-12-01 for synergy when surveillance cultures were found to be growing again GNR .
Gent and Cipro were then discontinued and changed to meropenem when blood culture sensitivities became available revealing GNR sensitive to Jacoby but resistant to both Gent and Cipro .
Additionaly surveillance cultures were drawn daily and the patient was transferred back to the floor with no subsequent pressor requirement .
Blood cltures from 11-30 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and 12-01 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and PROTEUS MIRABILIS both sensitive to the Meropenam which she had already been receiving .
Urine cultures from 11-30 grew STAPH AUREUS COAG + , and GRAM NEGATIVE RODS of two morphologies ( not further speciated ) .
She defervesed by 12-02 and remained clinically stable with normal blood pressures until the day of discharge .
At the time of discharge , blood cultures from 12-02 and 12-03 have no growth to date .
She received a midline on 12-04 with a goal of 16 days of further antibiotic treatment with Meropenam ( for a total of 3 weeks ) upon discharge back to the nursing home where she lives .
.
## Right hydronephrosis :
Given right sided hydronephrosis and GNR bactermeia , a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by IR 2014-11-30 .
The patient put out 1385 cc urine the day after placement , 950 cc of which came from nephrostomy tube .
The tube appeared to be functioning well , draining urine with occasional clot passage .
Urology was notified about the clots and occasional blood tinged urine but they did not make any further recommendations .
Cultures from urine drawn from the nephrostomy tube are currently growing > 100K GNR , possibly of two colony morphologies , speciation and sensitivity pending .
.
## Hct drop :
On admission to hospital patient had Hct of 29.2 .
In the setting of Right sublavian line placement as well as nephrostomy tube placement the patient was noted to have a drifting Hct , concerning for bleed , with nadir of 22.8 on 2014-12-01 .
A CT abdomen was performed which did not demonstrate any retroperitoneal bleed .
Hct stabilized to 24 for three days prior to discharge .
This can be followed as an outpatient .
Anemia workup revealed a picture of anemia of chronic disease ( TIBC 225 , B12 and Folate normal , Hapto 397 , Ferritin 51 , TRF 173 , Iron 35 ) .
.
## Hypoxia:
The patient on admission was requiring 3 L NC in the setting of receiving 2L NS and chest film which demonstrated pulmonary congestion .
The patient was not diuresed but allowed to auto-diurese any additional fluids and is currently with O2 sats 97-98% on room air .
As her BP remained stable she did not receiving any standing fluids but was be bolused as appropriate for a MAP < 60 or CVP < 8 with careful monitoring of pulmonary status .
Patient had an echocardiogram in 2012 which demonstrated an EF of 60-65% .
her O2 requirement by discharge was 96% on room air with no SOB .
.
## Steroid-induced hyperglycemia :
At home , the patient received metformin and SSI .
The patient 's metformin was held and she has been maintained on SSI qid while in the CMED .
As the patient appeared to be clinically stable , her stress dose steroids were discontinued and the patient was changed back to her home dose of Prednisone 40mg PO qd for maintenance with anticipated decrease in her blood sugars .
Her Metformin was re-added 2 days prior to discharge as well and fingerstick glucoses on the day of discharge were 93 and 156 , respectively .
.
## Hypothyroidism :
Repeat TSH and Free T4 were appropriate on current outpatient regimen. Patient was continued on Levothyroxine 75mcg po qd .
.
## H/o transverse myelitis/optic neuritis :
On stress dose steroids originally given MUST protocol and sepsis , as patient clinically stabilized , she was changed back to home dose of Prednisone 40mg pO qd .
.
## SLE :
Currently no sx of active disease .
No manifestations of SLE during this admission .
.
# Osteoporosis - We continued actonel/vit D , Tums
.
## Capsular ossification :
We continued CMED CSRU gtt .
.
## FEN:
She had a low bicarb likely due to renal wasting but there is an anion gap present .
Serum acetone was normal .
We followed lactate while she was in the CMED which was normal .
She was NPO periodically but maintained a normal diet prior to discharge .
.
# PPX - SQ Heparin during this admission , PPI

HOSPITAL COURSE :
In summary , patient is a 53 - year-old female with multiple medical problems and history of depression with intentional overdose of barbiturates , opiates , Tylenol , and beta blocker .
CMED :
Patient was maintained on insulin , D10 and glucagon drips to maintain her hemodynamics .
This was achieved with good effect , and they were subsequently weaned off .
Patient was able to be extubated on hospital day three .
Psychiatry was consulted after the patient was extubated , and felt that patient had a high suicide risk , and plan was for her to be admitted to the Psychiatry service once medically stable .
Patient 's renal function remained stable and her CKs trended down gradually .
Patient remained on suicide precautions , but was deemed not to need ICU level monitoring , and was transferred to the floor on 01-11 .
In the a.m. of 01/08 , the patient experienced episode of tongue biting , unresponsiveness , disorientation .
Was loaded on Dilantin .
Became progressively hypoxic and tachypneic throughout the day with respiratory rates of 30-40 with a max respiratory rate of 116 , tachycardia to 120s .
Patient subsequently was transferred back to the CMED CCU on 2017-01-13 for further monitoring .
Patient 's hypoxia was felt most likely to be caused by pneumonia .
She was started on appropriate antibiotics .
Etiology of patient 's tachypnea was unclear .
Initially , the patient 's etiology of seizure was not quite clear , but thought possibly secondary to alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal .
She received EEG , MRI , LP .
Subsequently EEG was noted to have no seizure activity .
MRI was suboptimal due to motion artifact and LP was unremarkable .
Despite absence of seizure activity on EEG , patient was continued on Dilantin .
Her delirium was felt possibly secondary to withdrawal versus toxic metabolic , but gradually improved slowly , and therefore patient did not receive treatment for barbiturate withdrawal .
Her mental status , tachypnea , and hypoxia all improved , and patient was subsequently transferred back to the floor medical team on 2017-01-15 .
While on the floor , the patient 's mental status was noted to be improved back at baseline compared to that back to the CMED CCU , and she exhibited no evidence of barbiturate withdrawal .
She was continued on suicide precautions with a one-to-one sitter , and plan was for psychiatric admission when medical issues had resolved .
On 2017-01-16 , the night float intern was called to see the patient as she was unresponsive .
Patient unresponsive to verbal command , sternal rub .
Pupils were fixed and dilated .
Patient noted to be without corneal reflexes , spontaneous breathing , heart sounds , or palpable pulses .
Patient was pronounced dead at 6:15 a.m. on 2017-01-16 .
Patient 's family was notified and declined autopsy .
Given the sudden unexpected nature of patient 's death , the medical examiner was contacted and the case was accepted .
Of note at time of death , patient was DNR / DNI .
This was initiated after several conversations with the patient 's mother , who stated that the patient had desired to be DNR / DNI for many years , not just in the recent past .
These facts were confirmed via separate conversations with both the patient 's lawyer and her primary care physician .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
Shortness of breath - Though the patient denied shortness of breath on admission , a progress note from
Norwood nursing facility suggested that the patient had been having shortness of breath and cough for approximately one day with difficulty ambulating , needing to travel in a wheelchair .
The patient was afebrile on admission with a normal white blood cell count but had significant wheezing and rales on physical examination with a possible left lower lobe opacity seen on chest x-ray .
The etiology of the patient 's shortness of breath was considered a likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and the patient was started on Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers .
The patient was also started on Doxycycline given the concern for pneumonia on chest x-ray .
She was also continued on steroids given evidence of severe airway obstruction .
The patient 's shortness of breath was also considered possibly related to a coronary event and she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
The patient 's enzymes were cycled and were negative .
The patient 's electrocardiogram performed on hospital day number two was concerning for 2:1 heart block and the cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation .
The patient was taken to the Coronary Care Unit late on hospital day number two and received a temporary wire .
The following day the patient received a permanent dual chamber rate responsive pacemaker .
The patient was transferred back to the general medicine service where she continued to exhibit signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and nebulizers , steroids and antibiotics were continued .
The patient 's respiratory status improved throughout the remainder of her hospitalization and oxygen was eventually weaned .
Once the patient was transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit , she appeared to have an element of heart failure in addition to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She was given 20 mg of intravenous Lasix with impressive urine output and improvement in her overall fluid status .
The patient was eventually restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix once her renal function improved to baseline and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization .
Heart block - As noted previously , the patient 's electrocardiogram was significant for a 2:1 heart block and cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation .
The patient received a temporary pacing wire on the evening of hospital day number two and on hospital day number three received a dual chamber pacemaker .
Renal - The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.8 , considered likely secondary to hypovolemia .
Her calculated fractional excretion of sodium was 0.13 percent suggesting a prerenal cause .
The patient 's creatinine improved to 1.1 with hydration .
Once the patient 's creatinine had improved to baseline , her Lasix and ace inhibitor were restarted and the patient 's creatinine was noted to be stable .
Gastrointestinal - The patient was admitted with a history of gastrointestinal bleed with guaiac positive stools on admission .
Her hematocrit was noted to trend down after transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells on admission .
Given guaiac positive stools and her history of gastrointestinal bleed in addition to use of steroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , the gastroenterology consult service was contacted .
The results of that consultation and potential esophagogastroduodenoscopy are pending at the time of dictation .
Hypertension - The patient had moderate control of her blood pressure throughout her admission .
Her calcium channel blocker and ace inhibitor were continued .
Hematology - As noted previously , the patient 's hematocrit was noted to drop after transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells on admission .
Given guaiac positive stools and the patient 's history of gastrointestinal bleed , gastroenterology consult service was contacted for possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or colonoscopy .
The results of this consultation are pending at the time of dictation .
The remainder of the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course , discharge diagnoses , medications and follow-up will be dictated at the time of discharge .

PROCEDURES :
Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy by Dr. **NAME[UUU] .
For details of history and physical , please refer to the dictated summary by Dr. **NAME[TTT] .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was treated with IV Dilaudid for management of pain , and his fentanyl patch at 25 mcg / hour was continued .
He was also given IV fluids and kept n.p.o. for the first two days .
Lab work for pancreatitis was ordered and this showed no recurrence .
Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed an actual improvement in his previous pancreatitis .
The peripancreatic cystic collection had completely resolved when compared to the previous CT scan .
The patient was seen by Dr. **NAME[XXX] , and was further evaluated with upper and lower GI endoscopies which were completely normal except for a small sigmoid polyp that was excised and this was a hyperplastic polyp .
Therefore , he underwent a small - bowel followthrough the following day , which was a completely normal study .
Both the Surgical Service and the GI Service felt that there was a huge functional component to his abdominal pain .
The patient continued to use IV Dilaudid around the clock and after all of the above testing came back normal , I had a long conversation with the patient and he was made aware of the fact that he needs to address his depression and anxiety problems with regular followup with a psychiatrist , and the Dilaudid was tapered and discontinued within 48 hours .
He was treated with p.r.n.
Percocet , and he did quite well .
Of note , throughout his entire stay whenever the patient was allowed to eat , he ate regular meals and had no symptoms of nausea , vomiting , or bowel habit changes .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Aug 17 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Aug 20 07]
I am seeing Mr. **NAME[AAA] for critical care at the request of Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] , as well as neurosurgery .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] was admitted as a fall .
He was found to have a left subdural hematoma .
He also has a history of seizure disorder and a biomechanical mitral valve replacement in the past .
He has been orally intubated and mechanically ventilated .
He has had failure to recover consciousness until recently .
The family and the nursing staff tells me that he does follow commands today at least with his left thumb , which he raises in response to command .
The patient 's temperature is 37 .
Blood pressure is 120/60 .
Pulse is 60 .
There are both atrial and ventricular pacer spikes , occasionally present , indicating that the patient has apparently a DDD pacemaker .
He is ventilated in the assist control mode at a rate of 14 , 650 ml tidal volume , 40% FiO2 and 5 of PEEP .
On those settings peak inspiratory pressure is in the mid 20s and he has unlabored ventilation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Significant for clear breath sounds bilaterally .
Heart is regular rate and rhythm .
His abdomen is soft , nontender , and not distended .
There are positive bowel sounds .
There is 1 + peripheral edema , and he is receiving SCD s for DVT prophylaxis .
Free Dilantin level is 2.1 .
Potassium is 2.8 .
BUN and creatinine are normal .
Phosphorous is 1.6 .
White blood cell count is normal .
He is tolerating Osmolite 20 ml / h. as well as cefepime day 2 , insulin , Keppra , Pantoprazole , Dilantin , and vancomycin .
EEG was reported as having no seizures .
As the patient has no fever and no white blood cell count and cultures are negative , I am going to discontinue the cefepime and vancomycin .
I am changing the Keppra to p.o. from IV .
I will speak to Neurosurgery and Neurology regarding potentially decreasing the Dilantin dose .
I am going to replace the patient 's phosphate to try to get his phosphate level up into the normal range .
I am going to decrease his IV fluids in an effort to allow him to be fluid negative .
I will continue him on his tube feeds and increase them as tolerated .
To try to augment diuresis , I am going to give the patient some spironolactone .
I am choosing this instead of our usual Lasix because of his persistent hypokalemia .
It is my hope that using this agent I can both affect some diuresis and correct his potassium .
I will do a CPAP trial on the patient , and if he tolerates that well , and if he is able to guard his airway well we can consider extubation sometime in the near future .
However , today his mental status is clearly not adequate to tolerate that .
Total time taken in the care of this critically ill patient is **AGE[in 40s] minutes .

Date of Birth :
2013-11-01
Sex :
F
Service :
Neonatology
HISTORY :
Mychelia Boyd was born at 28-2/7 weeks gestation and delivered due to unstoppable premature labor .
Mother is an 18-year-old prima gravida , estimated date of delivery 2014-01-22 .
Prenatal screens include blood type O negative .
Other prenatal screens were unknown at time of delivery .
Pregnancy was uncomplicated until the day of delivery when mother presented to HealthSouth New England Rehab Hospital Hospital with bleeding and was sent home .
She then presented to Jordan Hospital Hospital where she was noted to be 5 cm dilated with a transverse lie presentation .
She was given betamethasone times one and transferred to the Nantucket Cottage Hospital where she was delivered by cesarean section with rupture of membranes at time of delivery notable for slight meconium stained amniotic fluid .
The baby emerged with spontaneous cry , received routine care and then was intubated in the Delivery Room due to inconsistent respiratory effort and increased work of breathing .
Apgars were 6 at one minute and 8 at five minutes .
She was transferred to the newborn Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her admission physical revealed a birth weight of 901 gm , 20th percentile ; length 34 cm , 25th percentile ; head circumference 25 cm , 25th percentile .
Anterior fontanelle open , soft and flat .
Red reflex was difficult to appreciate bilaterally .
Pupils were large but equal and reactive .
Palate deferred due to oral intubation .
No defect noted during procedure .
Increased work of breathing prior to intubation , but presently comfortable .
Breath sounds slightly crackly , symmetric equal air entry .
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Peripheral pulses plus 2 and symmetric .
Abdomen soft without hepatosplenomegaly .
Three-vessel cord , clamped .
Normal female external genitalia .
Normal back and hips .
Skin was pink and well-perfused .
Appropriate tone and activity .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
Respiratory :
The baby was intubated in the Delivery Room , received two doses of surfactant .
Radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse granular pattern consistent with surfactant deficiency .
Maximum mechanical ventilation PIP 26 , PEEP 6 , rate of 25 , maximum FIO2 35 percent .
Mychelia was extubated to a CPAP of 6 cm on day of life two where she remained until day of life 20 .
On day of life two , she was also loaded with caffeine and continues on caffeine at time of transfer .
She was transitioned to a nasal cannula on day of life 20 and remains on nasal cannula O2 100 percent at 13 cc flow .
She averaged 2-3 apnea episodes a day with bradycardia and desaturations .
She has a comfortable respiratory rate and good air exchange .
Cardiovascular :
She received a normal saline bolus times one initially for poor perfusion and was started on dopamine with a maximum infusion rate of 6 mcg per kg per hour .
This was discontinued on day of life two to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 33 .
She has remained hemodynamically stable during the remainder of her hospitalization here .
Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition :
Initially maintained NPO .
UAC and UVC lines were placed upon admission to the CMED .
The UAC was left in place until day of life two and was removed after wean from dopamine .
UVC remained in place through day of life six and was utilized to administer parenteral nutrition .
Electrolytes and glucose remained in the normal range throughout the first week .
She was started on enteral feeds on day of life six with a slow advance secondary to increased abdominal girth which was felt to be due to CPAP .
She passed meconium .
She achieved full feeds on day of life 13 .
Calories were gradually increased to breast milk 30 calories with ProMod consisting of four of human milk fortifier , four of MCT and two of Polycose with a 12-28 teaspoon of ProMod per 50 ml of breast milk or 60 ml of formula .
On day of life six due to concerns for hyperglycemia and abdominal distention , sepsis evaluation was obtained .
She was noted at this time to have hyperglycemia requiring two subcutaneous doses of insulin and a decreased glucose infusion rate to achieve euglycemia .
This resolved that same day .
Urine output was always noted to be of sufficient quantity .
Gastrointestinal :
Mychelia demonstrated slow gastrointestinal motility and abdominal distention felt to be due to CPAP .
She was slow to advance on enteral feeds and gradually attained full enteral volume on day of life 13 .
On day of life 15 , she was made NPO for a distended abdomen and a bilious spit .
Serial KUBs revealed nonspecific changes with dilated loops .
No pneumatosis or free air was seen .
She was noted to have bluish discoloration thought to perhaps be a bruise on her left lower quadrant .
There was no radiographic correlation with this .
Feeds were restarted .
Again , she was advanced to full volume but was made NPO on day of life 20 for abdominal distention .
This NPO was temporary for that day and she then resumed feedings and has been tolerating full enteral feeds well , improved since off of CPAP , passing normal stools , guaiac negative .
Mychelia was also treated for physiologic jaundice .
She was started under phototherapy on day of life one through day of life three with a peak serum bilirubin of 4.7/0.3 .
This issue resolved .
Hematologic and Infectious Disease :
Initial CBC was notable for a white count of 5.5 with 49 polys , 1 band and 47 lymphs .
Initial hematocrit was 46.3 percent and platelets 320,000 .
Her initial blood culture remained negative and she received 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin .
As previously noted on day of life six with hyperglycemia , abdominal distention , a CBC and blood culture were again obtained revealing a white count of 9.1 with 30 polys , 0 bands and 58 lymphs .
Hematocrit at that time was noted to be 31 and platelets 370,000 .
Blood culture grew staph coagulase negative and the baby received seven days of vancomycin and gentamicin .
A lumbar puncture was also performed to rule out meningitis .
This culture remained negative with normal cell counts and chemistries .
Antibiotic levels were monitored and doses adjusted accordingly .
Mychelia required two transfusions during her hospital stay .
On day of life 15 for a hematocrit of 29 , she received 20 cc of packed red blood cells .
She started on iron and vitamin E supplements on day of life 25 and continues on that at this time of transfer .
However , on day of life 34 , 12-04 , she was noted to be pale and less stress tolerant , mottling easily with care .
A hematocrit and reticulocyte count showed a hematocrit of 23 percent and a reticulocyte count of 1.9 percent .
Therefore , with blood available from the first aliquot , a second 20 cc per kg of packed red blood cells were infused without incident .
Neurological :
Initial head ultrasound on day of life seven was normal .
At one month of age , on 12-03 , she was noted to have an absent septum pellucidum .
An MRI obtained and reviewed by the Hallmark Health System Radiology Department revealed focal gyral morphology consistent with prematurity , normal midline structures , normal myelination , no lesions , no signal abnormalities or extracerebral collections .
The cortical ribbon is intact .
The major vascular structures at the skull base are normal .
The septal leaflets may be partially absent , but there are no coronal images provided for confirmation and the pituitary stalk is present .
An Ophthalmology consult was obtained to determine the presence of optic nerves .
These were both determined to be present and intact .
Endocrine was also consulted .
Several labs were ordered .
Electrolytes and thyroid studies were noted to be in the normal range with serum sodium of 136 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 98 and CO2 34 .
She had a calcium of 10.3 , a phosphorus of 4.8 and alkaline phosphatase of 440 .
Thyroid function studies revealed a TSH of 2.2 , T4 of 5.7 , T3 of 101 and a cortisol level of 43 , all within the normal range .
A growth hormone was sent and the results were pending at time of transfer .
In addition , an FSH and LH were obtained on 12-10 and results are pending at time of transfer .
Please contact lab control at Mattapan Community Health Center for results : ( 409 ) 238-8236 .
The baby 's neurologic examination is appropriate for corrected gestational age which is 33 and 6/7 weeks on day of transfer .
By mother 's report , a maternal cousin also has an absent septum pellucidum .
Given normal pituitary tests thus far and normal optic nerve , no evidence of septic optic dysplasia .
Pediatrician should have low threshold for endocrinology reconsult if any signs of pituitary problems .
Sensory :
Audiology hearing has not yet been obtained .
This is recommended prior to discharge from hospital to home .
Ophthalmology :
Initial ROP screen was done on 12-02 and revealed immature retinas to zone 2 bilaterally .
They recommended follow-up examination due on the week of 12/20 .
Psychosocial :
Gardner State Hospital social worker has assisted in working with this family .
The contact may be reached at ( 754 ) 791 7976 .
Parents have been very involved and appropriate with infant and have eagerly learned to care for their baby .
Condition at time of transfer is good .
Discharge disposition is to level 2 nursery at Jordan Hospital Hospital .
Name of primary pediatrician is Ashley Daley of Village Pediatrics in Stockbridge .
Feedings at the time of transfer include breast milk 30 with ProMod at 150 cc per kg per day , all gavage given over one hour .
Medications include Fer-In-Norman , vitamin E 5 international units each day and caffeine citrate once a day .
Car seat positioning screening has not been obtained .
Newborn state screens have been sent per protocol .
Results have been in the normal range .
IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED :

Pleural fluid pH is 7.29 , glucose 91 , total protein3.1 , LDH 296 , 70 white blood cells , 50 red blood cells .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Colitis .
The patient has a history of ischemic bowel status post SMA Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty with recent admission for gram negative rod urosepsis complicated by C. difficile colitis .
The patient received a full course of Flagyl and was C. difficile toxin negative times three prior to transfer .
He now returns with fever , rising white count , diarrhea , and dehydration .
Initially treated with intravenous ceftizoxime , gentamicin , and Flagyl for presumed sepsis , either with urine or bowel source .
He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin .
Blood cultures and urine cultures came back negative .
Stool for C. difficile returned positive .
The diagnosis , therefore , was relapsed C. difficile colitis .
Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was continued on p.o. Vancomycin .
He improved clinically with defervescence , decreased white blood cell count to 10,000 with resolution of left shift , and some decrease in abdominal distention on exam .
An abdominal CAT scan revealed thickened bowel wall and thumb printing , primarily involving the cecum and right colon greater than the left , consistent with C. difficile colitis .
The diagnosis of recurrent bowel ischemia , however , was not ruled out and this will continue to be a concern in the future .
The patient was initially n.p.o. and was then advanced to clear liquids which he tolerated .
He will be advanced to soft solids prior to discharge .
2. Azotemia .
The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.8-2 .
Creatinine had risen to 4.3 on admission presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration .
With intravenous hydration the BUN and creatinine fell to 12/1.9 which is within normal limits for this patient .
The abdominal CAT scan showed no evidence of hydronephrosis orrenal abscess .
3. Mental status .
The patient was alert and oriented throughout the admission ; however , by personality , he is somewhat cantankerous and demanding of the nurses .
He was written for Haldol 1 mg p.o.b.i.d. p.r.n. to help with this problem .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
Medications on transfer include multivitamin 1 tablet p.o. q.d. ; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Ventolin inhaler two puffs q.i.d. ; Vancomycin 125 mg p.o. q.i.d. times seven days ; calcium carbonate 1250 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Lotrimin cream to groin b.i.d. p.r.n. ; O2 at four liters per minute ; and Haldol 1 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.

His potassium is 3.3 , this is in spite of receiving spironolactone for diuretic and potassium replacement .
His magnesium is in normal range but his phosphate is low .
I am going to continue to supplement this patient 's potassium orally / IV .
I am also giving him some potassium phosphate to bump up his phosphate level , as well as his potassium .
I am going to continue him on the spironolactone to try to spare some potassium , but he did have a fluid balance .
I am planning on extubating him and so I gave him a dose of Lasix as well .
I did extubate the patient .
Her has a very nice cough afterwards .
His voice is only slightly horse and he is appropriate .
I have asked Respiratory Therapy to deliver chest PT and assist him with cough .
His free Dilantin level is in the therapeutic range .
He is tolerating Keppra well .
His glucoses are controlled , less than 150 , so no additional medication changes were warranted .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Aug 23 07]
I saw the patient on rounds with the Critical Care Team and with the Trauma Team .
I interviewed and examined the patient at the bedside .
I reviewed the house staff note and agree with the findings .
I reviewed the data on EMTEK including vital signs , I&amp ; O , laboratory data , and medication list .
I discussed the management and plan with the Trauma Team and with the Critical Care Team .
The patient is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male who was found down .
He has a history of a seizure disorder .
He also has a pacemaker and is status post mitral valve replacement and has a reported history of significant ethanol use .
There were no events over night .
He has been afebrile .
He has not been tachycardic .
His systolic pressures are from the mid 90s to 120s over 50 to 72 diastolic .
He has been breathing spontaneously and maintaining good oxygen saturations .
Respiratory rate is approximately 20 .
His urine output has been adequate .
He has been tolerating tube feeds with osmolyte 50 ml per hour via an NG tube .
The patient complains of " pins and needles " from the knees down in both lower extremities .
On exam , he is more awake .
His speech is clear .
He is answering questions appropriately .
His smile is symmetric , although at rest while he is lying on his right side , his right lip was drooping .
He is moving all extremities .
His abdomen is soft and nontender .
His extremities are warm .
He has bilateral knee abrasions that are clean .
His white blood count is 2.6 , hemoglobin is 11.3 , platelets are 123 , magnesium is 1.7 , sodium is 141 , potassium is 3.8 , chloride is 105 , bicarbonate is 32 , and BUN and creatinine are 12 and 0.8 .
From a neurologic standpoint , Neurology recommends an EEG .
We will continue his Dilantin and Keppra with his seizure disorder .
From a respiratory standpoint , the patient is responding well to IPPB treatments for respiratory therapy .
He is currently getting them q. 4 hours and we will continue the q. 4 hour IPPB treatments .
We will also increase the patient 's activity , getting him out of bed to assist with his pulmonary status .
I am discontinuing his Aldactone which was started here in the hospital .
I will continue his tube feeds for the time being , however , now that he is more awake we will obtain a swallow evaluation and if he is not deemed a high aspiration risk , we will remove the NG tube and have the patient take his diet by mouth .
Because of the patient 's calf discomfort that he is describing as pins and needles , I am obtaining duplex looking for DVT ; however , my suspicion is that this is neuropathic type pain .
He does have good pulses ; however , this may be related to microvascular disease or possibly related to ethanol use .
I am giving him three days of multivitamins , thiamine , and folic acid treatment empirically .
The patient is stable for transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit to a monitored floor .

CT CSpine :
No evidence of cervical spine fracture .
Cervical spondylosis as described above .
CXR post CVL placement 09-23 :
A left subclavian vascular catheter terminates in the superior vena cava .
Several skin folds are present in the left hemithorax but there is no pneumothorax .
There are bilateral moderate pleural effusions , both of which have increased in size since the previous study .
New perihilar and basilar opacities may reflect pulmonary edema sparing the upper lobes in the setting of emphysema , but it is difficult to exclude underlying aspiration or infectious pneumonia in the lung bases .
Surgical clips are present in the left axilla .
09-25 CXR :
Interval development of large left pneumothorax with almost complete collapse of the left lung .
Brief Hospital Course :
79F w/ a multiple medical problems including Sylvia ( EF20% ) , COPD ( on home O2 ) , found down at home , pulseless - CPR initiated w/conciousness regained on scene .
At OSH ABG 7.19/94/110 , BiPAP started .
Pt found to be hypothermic w/ WBC 17 ( pt on steroids ) pnuemobilia and thickening of sigmoid .
Pt was transferred to The Hospital for Orthopedics for further management with wishes from the pt and family to reverse DNR/DNI status if surgery was indicated .
On transfer , the pt had VSS with a mildly tender abdomen without peritoneal signs .
It was decided to treat her conservatively with bowel and IV antibiotics .
She improved and was tolerating PO 's without difficulty after passing a swallow study .
Her Cpine was clearly with both a negative CT Cspine and clinical exam .
Her groin CVL was DC 'd after a L SC SVL was palced .
CXR confirmed good position and no PTx .
Overnight on HD 3 , pt became mildly agitated and an ABG was drawn which showed a severe resp acidosis and BiPAP was initiated .
The pt subsequently developed severe hypoxia with hypotension .
A CXR was obtained which showed complete collapse of the L lung thought to be a result of bursting a bleb associated with her severe COPD .
Family did not want a chest tube placed and decided to make the pt CMO measures .
On HD 4 pt continued to show a severe respiratory acidosis , was continued on a morphine drip , and was difficult to arouse .
At 6pm pt 's respiratory status worsened and she died .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 12 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 27 07]
I am personally managing the care of Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
He is receiving mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure .
I have examined the patient on rounds with the House staff .
I have reviewed the patient 's data and radiographs .
Events in the last 24 hours include temperature spike with significant hypotension requiring resuscitation with crystalloid and administration of stress dose corticosteroids .
IMPRESSION :
This is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male with a past medical history for double lung transplantation in **DATE[Jan] of 2006 , for emphysema , who presented on **DATE[Apr 12] , with dyspnea .
His course has been significant for transbronchial biopsies that first revealed no acute cellular rejection. He had empiric antibiotics and then had no growth in his bronchoalveolar lavage .
He required noninvasive ventilation with BiPAP , eventually having hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation .
One transbronchial subsequent biopsy showed evidence suggestive of diffuse alveolar damage .
He remains on mechanical ventilation currently .
KEY ISSUES :
1. Acute respiratory failure :
He is receiving mechanical ventilation - mode is PRVC FIO2 45% , respiratory rate 26 over a rate of 26 with a tidal volume of 430 cubic centimeters .
He has no significant compliance issues .
He actually tolerated some pressure support of 5 yesterday with adequate tidal volumes .
I am concerned since his CT scan of the chest obtained last night shows worsening air space disease .
2. Lung transplantation :
I am currently concerned about rejection versus pneumonia .
He is receiving empiric antibiotics consisting of cefepime and vancomycin .
We will obtain a bronchoalveolar lavage today , to rule out ventilator - associated pneumonia or opportunistic infection .
He has significant pulmonary hypertension and his recent transbronchial biopsy was complicated by significant bleeding .
We have asked our Lung Transplantation surgeons to consider open lung biopsy .
I feel if his alveolar lavage is unremarkable , we should obtain one , in an effort to find rejection that would require high - dose immunosuppression .
3. Adrenal insufficiency :
He had some hypotension .
I have placed him on hydrocortisone 100 milligrams intravenous every 6 .
4. Moderate mitral regurgitation :
His is on afterload reduction with hydralazine .
He is also receiving nitrates .
5. Immunosuppression :
He is currently receiving tacrolimus 0.5 milligrams twice a day .
His goal is 12 to 15 .
His tacrolimus trough today is pending .
6. Infectious prophylaxis :
He is receiving voriconazole 200 milligrams twice a day .
We have held his valacyclovir yesterday because of leukopenia .
He also is receiving Bactrim prophylaxis .
7. Chronic renal insufficiency with acute renal failure :
His urine output is adequate today with 625 cubic centimeters .
Yesterday , he had 3.4 Liters of urine , and his BUN and creatinine has stabilized 79/1.6 .
He is receiving enteric feeds .
Critical Care time spend exclusive of teaching and procedures provided throughout the day is 85 minutes .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation , new onset .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :
1. Transient ischemic episode .
2. Hematuria secondary to Foley trauma .
3. Multivalvular heart disease .
4. Alzheimer dementia .
5. History of prior cerebrovascular accident .
6. Chronic low back pain .
7. Benign prostatic hypertrophy .
CONSULTATIONS :
With Dr. **NAME[UUU] , Dr. **NAME[TTT] , and Dr. **NAME[SSS] .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This elderly gentleman from extended care facility was brought to the emergency room because he was found on the floor with unwitnessed syncope .
Examination in the emergency room revealed normal CT of the head with significant volume loss and small vessel ischemic changes .
His EKG , however showed atrial fibrillation .
Apparently , there is no previous documentation of similar arrythmia .
The patient was admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation , possible TIA .
He was evaluated by cardiology and he had further testing done , which revealed no major abnormalities .
The patient 's dementia was unchanged while in the hospital .
He did have catheter trauma because of Foley , which was eventually removed .
Initially he was put on heparin with Coumadin overlap , but secondary to the catheter trauma he had problems with bleeding and it was decided because of his advanced dementia that he may not be an ideal candidate for anticoagulation therapy .
He was put on rate control for his atrial fibrillation along with antiplatelet therapy .
He did very well while he was in the hospital and ultimately he was discharged back to personal care home .
Discharge medications included Tylenol 650 mg by mouth q.6 hours p.r.n. , aspirin 81 mg by mouth daily , Cipro 250 mg by mouth b.i.d. to stop on **DATE[Apr 25 2007] , digoxin 0.25 mg to alternate with 0.125 mg daily , Aricept 10 mg daily , metoprolol 25 mg by mouth b.i.d. , Protonix 40 mg daily , and potassium 20 mEq daily .

Off service note MICU intern signoff on **DATE[Apr 31 07]:
Mr. **NAME[CCC] is a **AGE[in 60s] yo male s/p double lung transplant on **DATE[Jan 07] for emphysema transferred to the MICU on **DATE[Apr 18 07] for dyspnea and increasing oxygen requirements .
The patient was admitted on **DATE[Apr 13 07] for productive sputum , fever and chills on transfer from a New Jersey ED where he recieved IV antibiotics .
For the first 4 days of his admission in the ICU he showed evidence of a new acute renal failure , elevated levels of serum tacrolimus , and tenous oxygenation on BIPAP and high flow oxygen .
Prior to the unit transfer the patient had a bronchoscopy with biopsy .
The results of that BAL were negative for acute rejection , bacterial , fungal , or viral infection .
The patient had a repeat bronch on **DATE[Apr 22 07] following intubation with a BAL that again had negative results for new infection , viral PCR for metapneumovirus was added found to be negative .
In the unit , the patient had evidence of malnutrition with a decreased serum albumin .
He had evidence of mild pulmonary hypertension and moderate mitral reguritation by TEE on **DATE[Apr 24 07] .
The patient underwent a repeat bronchoscopy and biopsy on **DATE[Apr 23 07] that was negative for acute rejection but had limited tissue .
The patient was on mild ventilator assistance but was kept intubated pending a decision on possible lung biopsy .
Transplant surgery was consulted and increased lung recruitment was initiated while the patient 's flecainide was discontinued .
Flecainide has association with flecainide-induced interstitial pneumonitis with hypoxemia and acute respiratory failure have been reported . Pneumonitis has occurred 2 to 22 months after beginning treatment with flecainide ( cumulative dose 12 to 100 grams ).
Other patients have recovered following withdrawal of flecainide ; however , at least 1 fatality has been reported ( Pesenti et al , 2002 )( Robain et al , 2000 ; Akoun et al , 1991 ; Hanston et al , 1991 ).
On **DATE[Apr 26 07] , the patient developed hypotension and became acutely febrile .
Cultures were drawn but have remained negative .
His hypotension was managed with fluid rescuitation and stress dose steroids and a new L IJ later that day he became afebrile .
He subsequently developed hypertension requiring the increasing of his beta blockers and hydralazine .
His tacrolimus levels decreased and his creatinine improved requiring increasing levels of prograf .
Current goal is 12 to 15 .
For antiobiotics he had remained on cefepime , voriconazole , nystatin , flagyl , prophylaxic bactrim throughout his stay with transplant ID adding tamiflu .
Vancomycin was discontinued and valcyte was stopped and then readded on 1/29 .
He was placed on neupogen on 1/26 until the 1/30 for decreased white blood count and should remain off of it as long as his ANC is greater than 1000 .
He went to the OR following a failed weaning trial in the am of 1/30 for a left lung biopsy , chest tube placement and tracheostomy .
Postoperatively he had remained stable .
Humeral rejection has been investigated on several biopies and the results remain inconclusive at this time .
He has remained on steroids and cell cept for immunosuppression throughout his admission .

CT head without contrast 2013-11-11 :
FINDINGS :
There is a large region of high attenuation within the right frontal lobe and the region of the right basal ganglia .
This is consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage , more likely hypertensive in etiology .
No significant subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhage is appreciated .
There is mass effect present with shift of the normally midline structures towards the left .
There is also left sided subfalcine herniation .
There is no hydrocephalus .
The visualized osseous structures and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable .
IMPRESSION :
Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe .
This most likely relates to hypertensive hemorrhage , as opposed to a ruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm .
Brief Hospital Course :
Patient was a 75 year old right handed male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin , coronary artery disease , hyperlipidemia , dementia with sudden onset left sided weakness , dysarthria .
Head CT demonstrated a large right intracerebral hemorrhage , centered around basal ganglia and putamen .
We felt this was likely secondary to hypertension .
While still in the emergency department , he had rapid decompensation necessitating intubation for airway protection .
Examination post intubation but off intubations showed clinical evidence of elevated intracranial pressure and brainstem compression .
The overall prognosis was guarded .
He was admitted to the Neurology / Neurosurgery ICU .
He was loaded with Mannitol and Dilantin in the emergency room .
He was evaluated by the Neurosurgery service and they did not feel a surgical intervention or ventriculary drain was warranted .
After arrival in the ICU , patient was followed with neuro checks every 1 hour .
Sedation was held to allow for frequent exams .
Head of bed was kept at 30 degrees .
Labetalol continuous infusion was titrated for systolic blood pressure of 130-160 .
Mannitol and Dilantin were continued .
After lengthy discussion , the patient 's wife opted to make him DNR on afternoon of 2013-11-11 .
Overnight , fresh frozen plasma was given for goal INR of < 1.4 .
On serial exams by neurology and ICU attendings in the morning on 2013-11-12 , patient had no clinical signs of brainstem activity .
Namely , he was unresponsive .
Pupils were fixed and dilated .
No corneal , gag , oculocephalic , and oculovestibular reflexes were elicited .
He was not overbreathing his ventilator .
At this point , patient was felt to have clinical signs consistent with brain death .
Plans were made to proceed with apnea testing .
However , after discussion with patient 's wife , this was postponed with test planned on 2013-11-13 .
Full medical care and managment continued overnight 11/9-11/20/2002 .
At approximately 06:00 on 2013-11-13 , the patient became bradycardic .
He lapsed first into a junctional rhythm and then had very infrequent ventricular escape beats on telemetry .
Finally , he went asystolic .
He was not resuscitated as per previous conversations with his wife .
Ronald was pronounced dead at 06:59 am .
The patient 's wife was notified .
The attending was notified as well .

Brief Hospital Course :
Impression :
71 yo m w/ astrocytoma on xrt and chemotx , who p/w 1 wk h/o productive cough , sick contact , hypoxic , now intubated , w/ increasing infiltrates b/l .
1) Resp failure - pt admitted w/ primarily hypoxic respiratory failure .
Following admission to the floor the pt developed increasing hypoxia and somnolence , requiring intubation on HD 5 .
Pulm had previously been consulted and felt that presentation was c/w PCP , Joann started on Bactrim .
Previously treated for CAP as outpt but hypoxia continued to progress .
Similar lack of improvement w/ additional broad spectrum coverage following admission .
Pt underwent bronchoscopy on 11-22 following transfer to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation ( 7.25/52/70 on 100% NRB ) .
On admission to the ICU the pt ' steroid dose was increased to 8 mg bid 03-07 to a dead space measurement of 50% .
Pt did well in the ICU , w/ his respiratory status steadily improving and was extubated on
01-03 .
He was subsequently tranferred to the floor , where he continued to have a stable oxygen requirement .
Repeat CXR was unchanged from previously in the ICU ( official read noted mild CHF , but pt was continuing to autodiurese and has remained net negative everyday while on the floor .
On discharge the patient has stable O2 req , 90% on RA .
2) astrocytoma - grade II , as per d/w PMD , Dr. Holscher , pt has poor prognosis , but reasonable for ongoing treatment .
Pt has had two recent neg head CT s , so unlikely the etiology of the patient 's MS change .
Pt was continued on keppra during admission for sz px .
Initially he had been on lamotrigine but the was stopped in 10/12 when the pt was noted to be developing a new rash .
Decadron has been steadily tapered since arrival on the floor .
Now continued on 1 mg BID , to complete a 7 day course , which will be tapered to 1 mg qday on 01-15 , and subsequently to 0.5 mg qday x 7 days then to be discontinued .
The patient 's keppra should be continued for sz prophylaxis .
3) MS change - on admission pt was agitated , requiring restraints and antipsychotics , however as he became increasingly hypoxic he became somnolent .
In the ICU the pt remained stuporous , responsive to painful stimuli .
On the floor the patient intially was imporved , but has plateaued , responding to simple commands and verbalizing groans but no real speech .
Improvement has correlated w/ tapering of steroids , one of the causes in the differential .
Pt had multiple head CT s which ruled out progression of astrocytoma .
MRI has been deferred given that the pt currently would not tolerate the procedure .
EEG was w/o evidence of epileptiform activity and c/w toxic encephalopathy .
Plan to continue to follow MS , expect improvement as steroids are continued to be tapered .
4) h/o DVT - cont heparin , previously on enoxaparin x10 days at treatment dose , followed by prophylactic dose .
On admission , the pt was started on treatment doses of enoxaparin .
Upon transfer to the Intensive Care Unit the pt was started on heparin gtt .
Course was c/b one episode of gross hematochezia on 12-28 , w/ concomitant hct drop of ~ 3 pts .
B/L lower ext duplex us and a cta were performed , both of which were negative .
Given that the pt was w/o evidence of DVT it was felt that the risks of anticoagulation in the setting of gross GIB , outweigh the risks of undetected deep vv thrombosis/pe .
Pt was continued on prophylactic heparin .
4) hypersensitivity reaction - on 11-24 pt was noted to have developing rash of abdomen and anterior thighs .
Derm initially reviewed and thought that it was not c/w hypersensitivity rxn .
Over the next the rash progressed , and the patient subsequently began spiking fevers to approx 103 F , c/b hypotension requiring aggressive fluid repletion and pressors , and tachycardia to the
130s .
The patient also developed elevated transaminases and pancreatic enzymes during this time .
On the second day that the rash had been noted , Derm was asked to see again , felt c/w hypersensitivity , bactrim was switched to pentamidine , and lamictal was held .
Pt continued to have elev pancreatic enzymes and pentamidine was switched to clinda/primaquine .
Following discontinuation of the bactrim the patient defervesced , and remained normotensive .
He received one dose of furosemide in the ICU and was transferred to the floor the next day .
On arrival to the floor the patient was noted to have a lacy reticular rash of upper arms , which resolved over the next 48h .
Felt likely 03-07 the sulfa moiety of the furosemide .
Plan for pt to complete total of 28 day course of therapy for PCP , James will be completed on 01-16 .
5) Anemia - previous w/u c/w ACD ( elev ferritin , low transferrin saturation ) .
- transfuse threshold < 24
6) ARF - Cr mildly elevated on tx to ICU , u lytes c/w prerenal azotemia , which resolved w/ IVF .
7) hyponatremia - also hyponatremic on transfer , resolved w/ ivf .
8) CAD - w/ abnl EF , however pt tolerated aggressive fluid resusciation w/o significant hypoxia .
Continued on valsartan , BB continued , statin
9) Nutrition - pt was maintained on TFs via post-pyloric
10) Px : Heparin ( full dose ) , IV PPI
11) Comm : Family very involved at bedside , evaluating rehab today
17) DNR , but may intubate for reversible causes
18) Restraint

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old African - American male with a history of sickle cell disease and end - stage renal disease .
He currently has a right basilic vein transposition AV fistula that was performed in **DATE[Mar] of 2006 .
He has been doing very well until over the past few days , he has had increasing swelling of his right upper extremity now associated with pain .
The patient has a known right innominate vein occlusion .
In the past , the patient has had his fistula remain patent despite this swelling .
Currently , he denies any numbness and pain in the extremity .
There is no evidence of any recent trauma .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Hemoglobin ( _______________ ) .
2. Sickle cell .
3. End-stage renal disease .
4. Seizure disorder .
5. GERD .
MEDICATIONS :
1. Nifedipine XL 90 mg daily .
2. Cozaar 50 mg p.o. daily .
ALLERGIES :
VANCOMYCIN CAUSES RED MAN SYNDROME .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with right upper extremity arm swelling , patient with a known innominate vein occlusion .
The patient on **DATE[May 8 2007] , was taken to Interventional Radiology for possible recanalization of his right innominate vein and / or subclavian vein .
The patient was also seen by the renal service to be given his dialysis treatment .
The patient was currently being dialyzed through a right groin tunneled dialysis catheter .
The patient had a venogram performed on **DATE[May 8 2007] , which showed an occluded right innominate vein .
This was unable to be recanalized .
The patient did have well - developed collaterals around this area of concern as well .
The patient was also seen by hematology / oncology for help with management of his sickle cell disease .
Over the next couple of days , the patient had an improvement of his swelling almost back down to baseline .
This was with the assistance of a **NAME[UUU] arm pillow .
The patient was notified that if the swelling persisted , most likely he would need a fistula ligation versus a venous bypass .
With elevation and heparinization , the patient 's arm swelling decreased .
There was no evidence of any clot seen on his venogram .
Therefore , the heparin was discontinued .
The patient 's arm was feeling much better and it was almost back down to baseline .
He was notified that if this were to persist , he should return to the emergency department or to the office to be seen .
The patient will follow up with Dr. **NAME[TTT ZZZ] and Dr. **NAME[SSS] from vascular surgery .
This will be for contemplation of a new AV fistula versus revision of his current fistula .
There is the possibility of needing an innominate vein bypass if the swelling continues , and he has no other options for hemodialysis access .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged in excellent condition .

** FINAL REPORT 2018-08-06 **
HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST ( Final 2018-08-06 ) :
NEGATIVE BY EIA .
( Reference Range-Negative ) .
GI bleed study - IMPRESSION :
Active radiotracer activity in the right lower quadrant in a serpingneous f fashion suggestive of distal small bowel .
EGD - Impression :
Angioectasias in the fundus
Angioectasias in the antrum
Angioectasias in the proximal jejunum and mid jejunum
Angioectasia in the duodenum
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid jejunum
Recommendations :
No site of active bleeding was seen .
The fundal AVMs are a potential site of bleeding although do not explain the extent of bleeding .
Consider endoscopic argon plasma therapy
Proceed with colonoscopy .
Colonoscopy -
Impression :
Blood in the colon
Grade 1 external hemorrhoids
Angioectasia in the colon
Diverticulosis of the colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Brief Hospital Course :
Blood loss anemia from GI bleeding - the bleeding was likely from an AVM .
EGD , colonoscopy and tagged scan results as above .
eventhough uptake was noted in the rt LQ , no clear site of bleeding was noticed on colonoscopy .
hence , no intervention was performed .
she was transfused with 5 units of PRBC in the ICU andsent to the Lahey Clinic - North Shore .
Her hematocrit remained stable for 4 days prior to discharge .
No further bleeding noted .
GI consult team followed pt in hospital .
On discussion with Dr Leigh and Dr White from GI - they recommended that she follow with Dr. Taylor for consideration of argon photocoagulation as out-patient .
Given the innumerable number of AVM 's , it is diffcult to assess which the culprit lesion is and GI may start APL from the fundus of stomach .
Patient to get CBC checked with PCP this week as below .
ASA was held and may be restarted if Hct stable in clinic at the PCP 's discretion .
Chronic thrombocytopenia was noted , however the patient did not require platelet transfusions .
Has a h/o HIT .
The metoprolol was held during acute bleeding phase and restarted prior to discharge as her BP stabilized .
Other medical problems stable .
Dialysis was continued 3 / week .
I personally talked with Dr Pannell at the time of discharge to update him with the hospital events .

DISCHARGE DATE : 
07/04/94 
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : 
Mitral stenosis . 
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : 
Tricuspid insufficiency , atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary hypertension . 
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 
04/22/94 , mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve reconstruction . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
This 68 year old female had rheumatic fever in the past , and has had chronic atrial fibrillation . 
She has had progressive heart failure and an evaluation demonstrated worsening mitral stenosis with severe pulmonary hypertension . 
Because of her deteriorating status , she underwent prior cardiac catheterization , which confirmed severe mitral stenosis with secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation due to pulmonary hypertension . 
She was referred for valve surgery . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY is remarkable for chronic lung disease due to smoking . 
She had undergone a previous nasal arterial embolization for treatment of recurrent epistaxis . 
She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 . 
Her MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included Coumadin , digoxin , 0.125 , qD , Lasix , 40 , q.i.d. , and Vanceril inhaler . 
PERTINENT EXAMINATION demonstrated mild elevation of her jugular venous pulse , with prominent V-waves , and systolic and diastolic murmurs . 
Peripheral pulses were all intact , and there was venous stasis changes on her legs , with some edema . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : 
The patient was brought to the Operating Room , on April 22 . 
She underwent a mitral valve replacement , utilizing a 27 mm . 
St. Jude prosthesis , and tricuspid valve reconstruction by ring anuloplasty . 
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with good hemodynamics . 
She initially awoke after surgery , with good hemodynamics . 
She was transiently in sinus rhythm , but atrial fibrillation recurred . 
She was extubated on the third postoperative day , and was initially slightly agitated and confused , largely due to an Intensive Care Unit psychosis . 
She continued to improve , with mobilization of fluid . 
She was initially noted to have a slow ventricular response in atrial fibrillation , but this gradually improved over time . 
She was initially noted to be somewhat anemic , and received transfusions . 
Coumadin was restarted , and her anticoagulation came into range . 
She was ultimately discharged with a heart rate in the 90 's , and with resolving edema and a clear chest . 
Her MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included Lasix , 40 , b.i.d. , potassium , 20 mEq. , b.i.d. , iron , and folic acid replacement , and Coumadin .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Epistaxis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Mitral stenosis , tricuspid regurgitation , heart failure , chronic atrial fibrillation , chronic ventricular ectopy , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
Epistaxis on Coumadin in the past .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Partial embolization of blood supply to nose , 8/22 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68 year old female has rheumatic heart disease .
Mitral and possibly tricuspid valve surgery is scheduled for Labor Day by Dr. Riemund C. Kennedy .
Her history is detailed in the discharge summary of August 10 of this year .
She is admitted now for a neuro-interventional radiology procedure to decrease the likelihood of epistaxis on Coumadin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Chest was clear .
Right neck and right groin catheterization sites were benign .
No edema .
Examination was otherwise unchanged .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit was 42 , PT was 10 , potassium was 3.6 , BUN was 29 , creatinine was 1.4 , blood sugar was 111 .
EKG showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , right ventricular hypertrophy , right axis deviation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The interventional neuro-radiology procedure was performed by Dr. A Skizeis , on August 22 , via the right femoral artery .
The right internal maxillary artery supply to the nasal mucosa was embolized .
The left external carotid artery was occluded at its origin , with collaterals from the internal carotid artery .
Thus , embolization on the left side was not possible .
The patient received Coumadin , 10 mg. , on the evening following the procedure , and is discharged the next day .
Her prothrombin time will be rechecked on August 27 by her primary care physician , Dr. Naka Gift .
Once her prothrombin time is in therapeutic range , she will be observed for epistaxis .
She will take her last dose of Coumadin on September 1 in anticipation of cardiac surgery .
If her prothrombin time does not come into therapeutic range promptly , then surgery may be delayed .
DISCHARGE REGIMEN :
Coumadin , 5 mg. , alternating with 2.5 mg. , qD , digoxin , 0.125 mg. , qD , Lasix , 80 mg. , qAM and 40 mg. , qPM , Vanceril , 3 puffs , b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Acute on chronic renal failure .
2. Hypertension .
3. Bradycardia .
CONSULTS :
1. Cardiology .
2. PT and OT .
STUDIES COMPLETED :
1. On **DATE[Feb 18 2007] , chest x-ray was normal .
2. On **DATE[Feb 19 2007] , ultrasound of the kidneys , no hydronephrosis or perinephritic collection , mildly increased cortical echogenicity and nonspecific finding of prerenal parenchymal disease .
3. On **DATE[Feb 23 2007] , chest x-ray showed very minimal fluid at the right base .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old African American veteran who presented to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Feb 18 2007] , complaining of a 4 - day history of lightheadedness , nausea , decreased appetite , fatigue , and chest pain .
He has a past medical history of chronic renal insufficiency , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , CVA , and last echocardiogram showed an EF of 55% in 2003 .
He denied any syncopal episodes , palpitations , shortness of breath , fever , or chills .
He was initially seen in the VA where he was found to be in a junctional rhythm .
His first troponin was negative and then he was sent to **INSTITUTION 's ED .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission showed sodium of 128 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 92 , CO2 19 , BUN 75 , creatinine 5.2 , glucose 105 , and troponin was negative .
White count 12.1 , hemoglobin 11.1 , hematocrit 31.8 , 90% neutrophils , 4% lymphocytes , and BNP 358 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
From a cardiovascular standpoint , he was admitted to a Stepdown Unit and monitored on Telemetry .
Cardiac enzymes were completed and were negative x 3 .
His beta blocker was held .
We asked Cardiology to evaluate his rhythm .
It was their impression that he likely had decreased p.o. intake and with his history of chronic renal failure and being on a thiazide diuretic and beta blocker , he became more dehydrated .
They recommended discontinuing his beta blocker and thiazide all together and placing him on Norvasc .
Once his medications were changed and he was adequately hydrated , he did return to a normal sinus rhythm in the 80 s .
However , his blood pressure became quite high with systolic pressures in the 170 s to 180 s .
He was on a maximum dose of Norvasc , and we added hydralazine q.i.d.
On top of this , we added a clonidine patch of 0.2 mg and then finally achieved blood pressure of less than 140 s .
In regards to his renal failure , it was likely acute on chronic renal insufficiency .
He was hydrated for several days .
His creatinine trended down rapidly , and the day prior to his discharge , it was 2.5 which we believe is his baseline .
Again , we did check a renal ultrasound which was without any significant findings .
In light of his renal insufficiency , we also put him on sodium bicarbonate tablets which brought his CO2 to normal range .
He does live alone and there was concern of his safety for discharge .
He was seen by Physical and Occupational Therapy as well as Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation .
It was of their opinion that he would be safe to be discharged home if he has assistance at home .
He does not need any inpatient rehabilitation .
We will discharge him home with home physical and occupational therapy as well as home nursing to check on his blood pressures and medication understandings .
The day prior to his discharge , he had an isolated temperature of 38.5 .
We checked a chest x-ray and urinalysis which were normal .
We also checked blood cultures which were pending at this time .
The patient denied any subjective feelings of fever , chills , dysuria , cough , and shortness of breath .
Therefore , we will discharge him home and have him follow up with his PCP or return to the ED if he has any more fevers .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital Signs :
He is afebrile .
At this time , T - max 38.5 , pulse 95 , respirations 20 , and blood pressure 140/60 .
He is 97% on room air .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 05 07]
I saw the patient on rounds with the trauma team .
I interviewed and examined the patient at the bedside .
I reviewed the house staff note .
I agree with the findings .
I discussed the management plan with the trauma team and with the patient .
The patient is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old female admitted yesterday with abdominal pain .
She reported had tripped over her dog and fell on steps , landing on her left side on **DATE[Feb 21 2007] and has been having some abdominal pain .
She also has a history of pancreatitis in the past of unclear etiology .
At **INSTITUTION she was found to have significant splenic injury and was transferred here for further evaluation and management yesterday .
The patient states that she had some p.o. intake this morning and feels somewhat bloated .
Her abdominal pain , however , is unchanged .
She is afebrile .
Her vital signs are stable .
Her sclerae are clear .
Her chest is clear anteriorly .
Her abdomen is soft .
She does have left - sided tenderness with voluntary guarding , no involuntary guarding .
Her extremities are symmetric , warm , and well perfused .
Neurologic is nonfocal .
Her hemoglobin and hematocrit that we have been checking have been relatively stable with no significant drop .
Her creatinine yesterday was 0.8 .
I looked at the CT scan from **INSTITUTION that was done on **DATE[Mar 04 2007] and there is evidence of splenic laceration with subcapsular hematoma about a grade 3 injury .
There is no free blood in the pelvis .
No other obvious injuries to my read .
She has her splenectomy vaccines ordered .
We are getting the patient out of bed with assistance today , and we will let her have diet as tolerated .
We will continue to follow her hemoglobin and hematocrit somewhat less frequently about every 12 hours that she has remained stable and this has delayed diagnosis .
I am going to check an amylase and lipase tomorrow and I am also going to obtain a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast tomorrow to evaluate for any progression or evidence of pseudoaneurysm formation .
I have discussed this with the patient .

1. Congestive heart failure exacerbation .
2. Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old male veteran who gets his primary care at the **INSTITUTION in the **PLACE Section of **PLACE who has a history of chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of approximately 2.3 , hypertension and CVA and peripheral vascular disease , presented initially to the **INSTITUTION with some lightheadedness , nausea , fatigue , and two brief episodes of chest pain .
The patient was found to be initially in an junctional rhythm .
The initial troponin there was negative and the patient was subsequently transferred to the **INSTITUTION Emergency Department , as there were no beds available at the **INSTITUTION .
LABORATORY , RADIOGRAPHIC AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC STUDY FINDINGS :
Procedures Performed / Studies obtained :
Ventilation perfusion scan of lungs and on **DATE[Feb 24 2007] which was low probability for pulmonary embolism .
Bilateral lower extremities Doppler 's studies done on **DATE[Feb 26 2007] which was negative for evidence of deep venous thrombosis .
Upper extremity Doppler 's done on **DATE[Feb 24 2007] negative for evidence of deep venous thrombosis .
CT scan of upper extremity done on **DATE[Feb 24 2007] which showed fluid within the independent portion of the distal arm likely represents dependent edema given fluid location , and underlying abscess could not be excluded without assessment of IV contrast .
Transthoracic echocardiogram done on **DATE[Feb 26 2007] which showed mildly dilated left ventricle with severely hypokinetic posterior wall and mildly decreased systolic function within his estimated ejection fraction of 45 to
50% , moderate MR , moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated PA systolic of 54 mm and mild LAE and mild TR .
Adenosine myocardial perfusion study done on **DATE[Mar 02 2007] which showed a high probability of coronary disease and ischemia and a large area of moderate severity .
There is defects visualized suggesting the presence of triple vessel coronary artery disease , ejection fraction of 46% , defects are visualized in mid LAD distribution on obtuse marginal distribution and RCA distribution .
Cardiac catheterization done on **DATE[Mar 05 2007] which showed left main with no disease , LAD with mid 80% stenosis just after take off of moderate diagonal branches .
Left circumflex with proximal subtotal occlusion gives off moderate sized OM - 1 and small to moderate sized OM - 2 which was seen filling faintly with left to left and right to left collaterals .
RCA dominant with mid 70 to 80% stenosis with right to left collaterals to the left circumflex OM distribution .
There were multiple chest x-rays .
Chest x-ray done on **DATE[Feb 18] and **DATE[Feb 23] which showed lungs to appear clear and chest x-ray done on **DATE[Feb 28] which shows interstitial pulmonary edema which resolved by chest x-ray on **DATE[Feb 21 2007] .
Therapeutic thoracentesis done on **DATE[Feb 30 2007] by Interventional Radiology with successful removal of 80 cc of yellowish fluid .
CONSULTS OBTAINED :
1. Nephrology consults :
**DATE[Feb 29 2007] .
2. Pulmonary consult on **DATE[Feb 29 2007] .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Junctional bradycardia .
Within a few hours of admission , the patient 's heart rate converted to normal sinus rhythm .
The patient continued initially to be bradycardiac .
His heart rate was 40 .
The patient 's bradycardiac persisted after conversion to normal sinus rhythm and so atenolol was discontinued .
However , the patient was overall stable from a cardiac standpoint and the patient was transferred to the General Medicine A-Service care .
While under the care of the General Medicine Service , the patient was transferred to the Medicine Service on approximately **DATE[Feb 19] .
However , under the care of the Medical Service , the patient developed tachypnea , bradycardia , or hypoxia with a new oxygen requirement of 5 liters nasal cannula .
The patient had not been on oxygen at all prior to this time .
Initial chest x-rays did not reveal any evidence of pulmonary edema .
There was concern for pulmonary embolism but a CT study with contrast could not be pursued , as the patient had a significant elevation of creatinine .
The patient 's creatinine initially on arrival to the hospital was 5.2 and at the time of his oxygen requirements , his creatinine was still in the 2.5 to 2.7 range .
The Medicine Service pursued an evaluation via Doppler studies which did not reveal any evidence of thromboses .
The patient also had a VQ scan that was low probability for a pulmonary embolism .
His EKG did not show any acute ST or T - wave changes .
The troponin were checked which showed an elevation of 1.49 on **DATE[Feb 25 2007] .
His troponin earlier in admission when the patient was initially admitted were negative times 3 on **DATE[Feb 18] .
The General Medicine Service subsequently consulted the Cardiologist who evaluated the patient and felt that he should return to the care of the Cardiac Pavilion Service .
Meanwhile , the patient had been treated with heparin drip for presumptive PE treatment and this was continued to for three to four days after his VQ scan did not show PE .
This was being done as clear etiology for his shortness of breath which is still not elicited .
The patient had transthoracic echocardiogram done on **DATE[Feb 26] which showed some wall motion abnormalities but ejection fraction was only mildly decreased at 45 to 50% .
There was moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension as well .
The patient was also showing peripheral edema on exam and the volume was thought to be a contributor to his symptoms .
Several chest x-rays to this point has still not shown any interstitial edema but on **DATE[Feb 28] , chest x-ray did begin to pulmonary edema and by this point , pulmonary embolism had been ruled out .
The patient was receiving diuretic therapy at smaller levels of Lasix at approximately 20 mg IV twice daily .
His creatinine was elevated in the high 2.5 to 2.8 range , so initially these doses were used carefully .
There was some verbal report from someone who had reviewed records at the **INSTITUTION that there maybe some possible interstitial lung disease history in the patient and therefore the Pulmonary Service was also consulted for their input , as the primary lung disorder being the etiology of the patient 's dyspnea .
However , further review did not show any sort of evidence of work-up or reason the patient should have interstitial lung disease .
This could not be further evaluated because the patient was very , very orthopneic that he could not tolerate a CT scan by laying flat .
The patient 's was also seen by the Nephrology Service around that time who recommended more aggressive diuresis .
The patient 's diuretic regimen was quickly escalated to 80 mg q. 8 hours .
In addition , the Pulmonary Service noted that he had moderate pleural effusions bilaterally on his chest x-ray and recommended therapeutic thoracentesis .
A therapeutic thoracentesis was done from approximately 100 cc of fluid .
No pigtail catheter was placed .
This was done on the left side under Interventional Radiology guidance .
Meanwhile , the patient 's urine output significantly increased with the diuresis and his orthopnea improved .
The patient 's O2 requirements began to decrease .
He was at 5 liters of oxygen for approximately one weeks duration , but the patient 's diuretics eventually assisted in his overall symptomatic relief .
Eventually , the patient was no longer on any sort of supplemental oxygen and his orthopnea resolved as well .
Overall , the patient 's symptoms were felt to be due to CHF exacerbation , as the patient was believed to have diastolic dysfunction .
He has a history of MR as well and hypertension which maybe playing a role in this .
Coronary disease :
Once the patient began to stabilize from the heart failure exacerbation , furthers cardiac testing was pursued since the patient had a troponin elevation earlier .
An adenosine myocardial perfusion nuclear thallium stress study was performed .
This was highly suggestive of three - vessel coronary artery disease .
The patient 's creatinine at this time had leveled off in the 3.0 range and though there was a risk that the patient may suffer increased kidney injury from dye exposure , it was felt that the patient 's benefits outweigh the risks and that cardiac catheterization should be pursued .
It was explained to the patient that risks and benefits of the catheterization and the need for him to be on dialysis as a result .
However , the patient did agree to further work - up , as he may have significant underlying coronary disease that would otherwise go undiagnosed .
The cardiac catheterization was performed on **DATE[Mar 05] , that revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease .
The patient had a mid 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery just after take off of a moderate sized diagonal branch .
She had a left circumflex out of proximal subtotal occlusion and the RCA also had a mid 70 to 80% stenosis .
See full cath report for further details , but see the recommendations at that point , we can pursue coronary artery bypass graft surgery .
The attending physician , Dr. **NAME[PPP] spoke to the VA hospital Administrators , as well as , VA Telemetry attending , Dr. **NAME[OOO] and the VA hospital agreed to accept the patient for further care of his coronary artery disease and referral evaluation for coronary artery bypass graft surgery .
Acute kidney injury :
ON chronic kidney disease .
The patient presented initially with a creatinine of 5.2 on **DATE[Feb 18] by **DATE[Feb 23] , his creatinine had come down to 2.5 and is felt to be pre - renal in origin .
Subsequently however , the patient 's creatinine again began to climb , as the patient developed the dyspnea symptoms and his creatinine peaked again to a level of 3.5 on **DATE[Feb 31] .
The patient was seen by the Nephrology Service on **DATE[Feb 29] , who followed very closely as the patient was showing evidence of advanced kidney injury and possible need for further renal replacement therapy .
However , they recommended radiographic diuresis and with such treatment , the patient 's excessive fluid was removed and his creatinine levels subsequently stabilized .
AT the time of this dictation and for the last four days , the patient 's creatinine has leveled off at 3.0 .
In addition , the patient was placed on Aranesp for __________ that maybe related to the chronic kidney disease , as well as , supplemental oral bicarbonate .
It was 650 mg t.i.d. but on transfer orders this was being placed at b.i.d. since the patient 's bicarb has been slightly elevated at 29 .
The patient 's creatinine continues to be monitored as the patient has recently had a cardiac catheterization and ultimately the patient should have outpatient follow up with a Nephrologist due to his advance chronic kidney disease .
Anemia .
The patient 's hemoglobin on presentation was 11.1 .
This did bottom out a level of 7.6 on **DATE[Feb 31] .
Around this time , the patient had been on heparin empirically for PE treatment and the drop occurred during that course .
The patient 's stool did have heme positive results on it on **DATE[Feb 29] , but there was no gross blood seen .
The patient did receive 2 units of packed red blood cells for transfusion and off the heparin , the hemoglobin did stabilize .
Hypertension :
The patient 's blood pressure medications were adjusted during the hospital stay .
Initially , the patient had been on Norvasc .
However , with the edema , the patient 's Norvasc was titrated to off .
In addition his hydralazine was titrated up as well as the patient 's beta blockade .
On **DATE[Mar 05] , 32007 , the patient 's beta blockade was increased to 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
He still is hypertensive and will likely need better blood pressure control .
There is still room to go up on the patient 's clonidine and also add back calcium channel blocker if need be .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 19 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Dec 22 07]
I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old gentleman with several complications arising from his severe biliary pancreatitis with a most recent procedure for debridement of a necrotic gallbladder , placement of a PTC catheter , repair of SMA pseudoaneurysm .
He is also suffering from ARDS , malnutrition and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the Vascular and General Surgery Team , as well as the Critical Care house staff .
The problems and management are as follows :
1. Gallstone pancreatitis .
The patient was started on Oxepa through the J tube , and he seems to be tolerating tube feeds at the moment , and they are also refeeding his PTC drainage back into his tube feeds to prevent excessive biliary losses .
2. Respiratory failure .
The patient is recovering from his ARDS , and we are planning to switch him to pressure supported ventilation today .
3. Hypertension .
The patient is currently on Captopril and Lopressor for his blood pressure management .
His recent blood pressures from the arterial line were up to 180 mmHg systolic with a diastolic around 100 ; so , today we will increase the doses on the Captopril as well as on the Lopressor before adding a new agent .
4. Malnutrition .
The patient has been started on Oxepa , and he still has low serum albumin levels , as expected , and we are planning to continue with G tube feeds as tolerated , and this will be a slow progress .
5. Infectious problems and sepsis .
On blood cultures from **DATE[Dec 11 2007] , the patient had Pseudomonas and enterococci , and he is currently on linezolid and meropenem for the management of infectious process in his blood as well as is his abdomen .
6. GI prophylaxis .
The patient is on GI prophylaxis with Pepcid .
He is on heparin drip for his SMA graft as well as for DVT prophylaxis , and he has additionally SCDs .
He is on a sliding - scale insulin for blood glucose management .
THE TOTAL TIME SPENT ON THIS PATIENT WAS 33 MINUTES .

PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE BREAST .
OTHER PROBLEMS :
1. HYPONATREMIA , 1-13-94 .
2. PULMONARY EMBOLUS , 1-14-94 .
3. DIARRHEA , NAUSEA AND VOMITING , FEVER .
4. HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .
She was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .
The patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .
A mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .
However , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .
Fine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .
Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .
Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .
Dr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .
The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .
The margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .
Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .
The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .
Estrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .
The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .
Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .
Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
The patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .
There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .
However , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .
ABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .
Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .
The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .
Basically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .
Although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .
She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .
Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .
She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .
It was treated with gent and Cipro .
Re-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .
In May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .
In mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .
The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .
She has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .
We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .
UTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .
Status post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 .
She had menarche at age 15 .
She used the pill for five years in the past .
She is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .

HEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .
Neck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .
Lungs were clear .
Chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .
Cardiovascular - Normal .
Abdomen - Normal .
There was no HSM .
Extremities - Her left arm was very swollen .
It was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .
There was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .
Neuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .
She also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .
Cranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .
Toes were downgoing .
LABORATORY DATA :
Of note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .
PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .
ALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .
Cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .
UA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .
Chest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .
In summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .
The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .
When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .
So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .
Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .
She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .
Another major issue with this patient was pain control .
She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .
So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .
One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .
After that the patient had minimal relief of pain .
However , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .
So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .
She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .
She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .
We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .
Other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .
We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .
In addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .
That has been stable .
The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .
Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .
A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .
We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .
We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .
In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.
So that has really improved .
We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .
On the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &apos;s hump .
Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .
So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.
Her INR is 2.3 .
We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .
So if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .
However , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .
Other major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .
We put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .
So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .
If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .
The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .
She is also a little dry .
The patient is on oxygen .
Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .
She was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .
We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .
The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .
DISPOSITION :
Discharge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Fair .
She remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .
She is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .
Follow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .
The appointment has already been made .
The patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .

The patient was admitted for catheterization .
He was known to have a high - grade right coronary lesion which is a codominant , but large vessel .
It had 90% disease .
We used a 2.5 balloon to predilate the lesion , and then deployed and implanted a 3.0 x 28 Cypher stent .
We had to use a postdilatation balloon at high pressures to fully deploy the stent .
This was a 3.0 balloon as well .
His discharge medications are same as he was admitted on .
He will need long - term aspirin and Plavix .
FINAL DIAGNOSES :
1. Coronary artery disease .
2. Coronary stenting .
3. Obesity .
4. Hypertension .
5. Hyperlipidemia .
6. Diabetes .

The mother 's prenatal screens were blood type B positive , antibody negative , rubella immune , RPR nonreactive , hepatitis surface antigen negative and group B strep negative .
This pregnancy was complicated by a prenatal diagnosis of a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation
( CCAM ).
The mother was followed in the Massachusetts General Hospital Advanced Fetal Care Center and was followed by Dr. Ralph Wilson .
The mother had spontaneous onset of labor and progressed to a spontaneous vaginal delivery .
The infant emerged vigorous with Apgars of 9 at one and five minutes .
His birth weight was 2905 grams .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Wt 2905 gm
Length 19 inches
HC 34.5 cm
His admission physical exam reveals a vigorous nondysmorphic term infant .
Anterior fontanelle open and flat .
Palate intact .
Red reflex not checked .
Neck supple and without masses .
Clavicles intact .
Lungs clear bilaterally with slightly decreased breath sounds on the right but symmetric chest rise and fall .

Abdomen soft , nontender , nondistended , active bowel sounds .
Normal male genitalia , testes descended bilaterally .
No sacral anomalies .
Stable hips .
Patent anus .
Age appropriate tone and reflexes .
CMED CCU :
By systems :
Respiratory status :
He has remained in room air well saturated with comfortable respirations until approximately 22 hours of age when he started with increased work of breathing although he has remained well-saturated in room air .
His chest x-ray was initially remarkable for some mediastinal shift due to the right-sided lesion with increasing shift present on the last x-ray .
Cardiovascular status :
He has remained normotensive throughout his CMED stay .
There are no cardiovascular issues .
Fluid , electrolytes and nutrition status :
His weight at the time of transfer is 2800 grams .
He has been breast feeding or taking 20 calorie per ounce formula until the increased respiratory distress so that at the time of transfer he is NPO with a peripheral IV with total fluids of 150 ml / kg / day of 10% dextrose with electrolytes .
He has had no blood work except for blood glucose checks and he has been euglycemic throughout his CMED stay with his blood glucose being in the 70s .
Gastrointestinal status :
He has passed meconium stool and is voiding with each diaper change .
He has not had a bilirubin checked .
Hematology :
He has not had any blood work done .
Infectious disease :
He has had no antibiotic therapy or blood cultures sent .
Sensory :
Audiology :
Hearing screening is recommended prior to discharge .
It has not been done yet .
Psychosocial :
The mother has 3 older children who are alive and well .
Her own mother has been with her during this stay .
The infant is discharged in guarded condition .
He is being transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital Newborn Intensive Care Unit for continuing care .
His primary pediatric care provider will be Dr. Schrader at Deaconess-Nashoba Hospital .
RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER DISCHARGE :
1. Feedings :
The infant is NPO .
2. He is on peripheral IV of total fluids 150 ml / kg / day of 10% dextrose with 2 mEq of sodium chloride per 100 ml and 1 mEq of potassium chloride per 100 ml .
3. He has not had a car seat position screening test .
4. A State newborn screen will be done prior to transfer .
5. He has received no immunizations .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 13 07]
I personally interviewed and examined the patient today .
The patient is complaining of continued abdominal pain generally at lower abdomen and mid lower abdomen .
The pain appears to be somewhat worse today .
Her shortness of breath is about the same or better .
She is still coughing .
She denies any dizziness or lightheadedness .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Overnight , her blood pressure went down as low as 60 systolic .
Her heart rate was also elevated .
She was afebrile .
Her mental status remained normal .
She was given fluid volume bolus with blood pressures coming up into the 80s and 90s .
She is in no acute distress this morning .
Her chest exam is the same with some wheezes .
Heart is regular .
Abdomen , there is no tenderness or masses .
Aneurysm size is about 6 cm on my examination today .
Extremities :
There is no edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Her electrolytes are normal as well as renal function today .
Her hemoglobin though is decreased to 10.9 from 13.9 .
This was repeated and the repeat number is the same .
PROBLEMS
1. Abdominal pain .
We are concerned about leakage of aortic aneurysm .
We will get a STAT CT scan today .
I am particularly concerned about it because her hemoglobin has dropped as well and she was hypotensive overnight .
She was given fluids .
2. COPD .
She is getting nebulizers and will continue those .
She appears to be stable regarding respiratory status .
3. Anemia .
The etiology of anemia is not quite clear .
She has no GI bleeding and in fact is constipated .
We will check CT scan of the abdomen , and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin and hematocrit .

None
History of Present Illness :
The patient is a 83 yo R-handed man with a history of multiple intracranial hemorrhages during the last few years , pacemaker , hyperlipidemia , arrhythmia who now presents with gradual decline in gait and slowing of mentation over the last week .
The patient had a fall about ten days ago , when he was walking the dog .
The leash got wrapped around his legs .
According to his wife he had a small abrasion on the top of his head , but nothing major .
He did not complain about a headache .
He was at baseline with respect to his gait ( at baseline unsteady , though he refuses to walk with a walker ) and his mentation ( at baseline difficulties with memory since months ; keeps forgetting appointments ).
Then about a week ago , the patient and his wife noted that his gait became even more unsteady , though he did not fall .
He also had difficulties navigating through his apartment , having difficulties finding the fridge for example .
They were concerned that the fall might have caused another bleed , as had happened in the past , and this prompted them to come to the Deanna .
No headache , neckpain , nausea , vomiting or focal weakness / numbness .
Review of systems : denies any fever , chills , weight loss , visual changes , hearing changes , dysphagia , tingling , numbness , bowel-bladder dysfunction , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , dysuria , hematuria , or bright red blood per rectum .
His legs have been feeling weaker , bilaterally since the last week .

06-30 resolved as of repeat head CT one month later , no residual deficits; 03-03 : ICH in 3rd , 4th , and L-lat ventricle ; no aneurysm ; 07-01 : ICH in R-temporal lobe ; question of underlying mass at that time per contrast CT ; decided to follow up with serial scans rather than to biopsy
2. pacemaker placement for arrhythmia , Afibb ; during last hospitalization episodes of NSVT
3. history of slowness of gait , ? parkinsons ? and possibly dementia followed by Dr. Ahern ( Laurence Eichorn ).

CT BRAIN ( INITIAL )
FINDINGS :
There is a 41 x 23 mm area of hyperdensity within the right frontal lobe , with moderate surrounding vasogenic edema
( series 2 , image 23 ) , compatible with acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
The chronic encephalomalacic changes at the adjacent right frontal lobe and the right parietal / occipital region remain stable in appearance .
There is mild mass effect upon the anterior Mims of the right lateral ventricle .
No further intraaxial or extraaxial fluid collections or hematoma are identified .
There is no displacement of the normally midline structures , hydrocephalus , or effacement of the basal cisterns at present .
Review of bone windows demonstrates no skull bulge or skull base fracture .
There is an air / fluid level within the right maxillary sinus - ? acute sinusitis , but acute blood cannot be excluded , in the setting of acute trauma .
CONCLUSION :
41 x 23 mm acute intraparenchymal hematoma at the right frontal lobe , causing mild mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle , suspicious of hemorrhage secondary to congophilic angiopathy in this age group .
Chronic encephalomalacic changes at the right frontal lobe and right parietal / occipital region are unchanged in appearance since 2018-11-27 .
REPEAT HEAD CT 03-30 : no significant change from above .
EKG :
Atrial pacing .
Since the previous tracing of 2018-03-15 atrial pacing is a new finding .
The electrocardiogram is otherwise , unchanged and continues to Weymouth voltage in the limb leads and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .

Brief Hospital Course :
The patient is a 83 yo man with a history of past intracranial hemorrhages ( most recent 07-01 with R-frontal hemorrhage ) who presented with gradually slowing of mentation and increased gait instability since one week .
On initial exam the patient was not oriented to time , seemed somewhat slow , and had difficulties generating a list of animals .
His cranial nerves and strength were full , and the sensory exam showed mildly decreased vibration and proprioception in both LE , suggesting peripheral neuropathy .
A CT was performed in the Deanna that showed a new significant R-frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the same location as the prior bleed .
The patient was seen by both neurology and neurosurgery , and the two teams agreed that the etiology seemed to be related to underlying amyloidosis .
During the last admission the question of a mass underlying a hemorrhage in the R-frontal region was raised .
The location of the hemorrhage was not felt to be typical for hypertensive bleed ( cortical ) and it was felt to be unlikely that the recent fall was related to the bleed .
The patient could not undergo an MRI due to his pacer .
He was admitted to the neurology ICU for closer monitoring and was stable overnight - BP was initially elevated and required a labetalol drip for < 24 hours , then stabilized .
The goal SBP of < 150 was achieved .
Coags and UA were checked and were normal .
For the question of seizure activity associated with a cortical bleed , he was started prophylactically on Keppra ( given questionable allergy to dilantin ) , at 500 mg bid ; no seizure activity was seen .
This medication should be continued as an outpatient at least while the bleed has time to clear up , with planned titration up to 1000 mg bid on 04-05 .
Head CT repeated on 03-30 was unchanged , and the patient remained stable with only very suble focal exam findings ( very mild right pronator drift ) as well as his persistently poor memory related to dementia .
The plan after 24 hours was to transfer him to the floor , but the hospital was full and he never got a bed .
Cardiovascularly , lipitor and amiodarone were continued .
He could not get an MRI due to his pacemaker .
There were no telemetry events , and he ruled out by enzyme .
Pulmonlologically , his chest xray was negative and he complained of no breathing problems .
Endocrinologically , BG was monitored to improve outcome in ICU setting though he had no history of DM .
Of note , Hba1c done 03-04 was slightly elevated ( " borderline DM " ) at 6.3 ; this was repeated and was still pending on the day of discharge .
Ins / outs and electrolytes were monitored and were not abnormal ; he was on a bowel regimen , VD boots and PUD prophylaxis with protonix during the admission .
Walking was assessed later and the patient was unstable on his feet .
PT was asked to see him for this gait problem .
Brandon felt well and was seen by PT who suggested a rehab/Hahnemann Hospital ( Worcester ) to work on walking with the eventual goal of returning to assisted living with his wife when walking improved .
Follow-up was arranged with neurosurgery in 5-6 weeks with repeat head ct to be arranged by neurosurgery office to make sure blood has cleared , and if indicated , to look for a possible underlying lesion ( although unlikely ) .

LABORATORY DATA :
Coagulation profile notable for a PT 18 , PTT 36.7 and an INR of 2.4 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and begun on cefotetan and Flagyl , as well as heparin .
Her INR dropped to 1.6 prior to surgery , and her PTT was in the mid 80s prior to surgery .
She was admitted and placed on a bowel prep two days before surgery and was taken to the Operating Room on hospital day # 3 , 10/28/97 .
At that time , she underwent sigmoid colectomy and ventral hernia repair . ( A full account of this operation can be found in the Operative Note ) .
She tolerated this procedure without complications initially and was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition .
Postoperatively , she had her heparin restarted , and had a PTT rising to 142.8 and then down to 92 .
Her primary postoperative development was the passage of some blood clots and blood per rectum on postoperative day # 2 .
She continued to pass blood per rectum and was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells .
Her preoperative hematocrit was 41 and her hematocrit dropped to 30.4 on postoperative day # 2 .
This was a drop from an immediate postoperative hematocrit of 35.4 .
Upon receiving the one unit of red blood cells , her hematocrit returned to 33 , and in the two days subsequent to the transfusion , returned to 34 .
Otherwise , her postoperative course was uneventful with gradual resolution of the passage of blood per rectum .
Her heparin was discontinued when it was noted that she was bleeding per rectum and her PTT drifted to a normal range of 35 by postoperative day # 3 .
On postoperative day # 1 , the patient was restarted on 2 mg of Coumadin .
However , due to the episode of bleeding on postoperative day # 2 , the Coumadin was held for two consecutive days , and then restarted on postoperative day # 4 .
At this time , she is given 3 mg and was gradually increased to her regular regimen of 4 mg alternating with 3 mg.
The patient &apos;s INR had dropped to 1.7 at the time of operation , and remained in this range initially , but began to rise to 2.0 with her Coumadin dosing .
At the time of discharge , it was 1.9 , for which she received 4 mg.
On the next day , it was 1.6 and she returned to a normal dosing of 4 mg followed by outpatient draws to determine the further Coumadin dosing .
This was postoperative day # 6 , at which time she is ready for discharge .
The rest of her hospital course was unremarkable , with perioperative ampicillin , gentamicin and Flagyl discontinued on postoperative day # 1 .
She had some initial nausea but had no emesis .
Her nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day # 1 , and she tolerated a regular diet by postoperative day # 3 .
She had flatus and regular bowel movements by postoperative day # 5 .
She also complained of some slight dizziness upon getting up .
For this reason , her normal Lopressor and Norvasc were held .
It was felt that this was re-equalibration after being sedentary and mostly in bed following the operation .
She had some slight headaches which resolved with Tylenol , and the dizziness resolved as well .
She was ready for discharge on postoperative day # 6 .
Her wound remained benign and was healing nicely at the time of discharge .

4. PNEUMONIA .
5. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE .
6. RIGHT LUNG NODULE .
7. COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT .
STUDIES :
The following studies were done : x-ray of the knee shows osteopenia with chondrocalcinosis .
X-ray of the femur shows moderate osteoarthritic changes of the medial joint space with a chondrocalcinosis .
No acute abnormality of the distal and proximal femur .
Last chest x-ray showed no acute infiltrates .
It was done on **DATE[Sep 19] .
CT of the abdomen shows a 1 cm low density lesion in the anterior segment of the right lobe of the liver which likely represents a cyst .
Also 1.6 cm low density lesion in the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver which probably represents hemangioma .
Spleen , pancreas , adrenals and kidneys are normal .
In pelvis , fibroid in the uterus .
There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid .
Also in pelvis there is sclerotic destructive lesion at L5 , in right iliac wing , and in right greater trochanter consistent with the patient 's known history of metastatic disease .
There is also pathologic left femur fracture .
MRI brain shows no evidence of metastatic disease on the current examination .
MRI of the L - spine shows a diffuse infiltrate process consistent with metastatic disease .
MRI joint lower extremity showed ( 1 ) diffuse marrow replacement with more confluent metastatic foci involving the left greater trochanter , right sacroiliac joint and the L5 vertebral body , ( 2 ) a fracture through the greater trochanter , left femur and an impending intratrochanteric region left femur , ( 3 ) possible cortical breakthrough and local spread of neoplastic disease involving the soft tissues and muscles surrounding the left greater trochanter .
Bone scan showed ( 1 ) multiple foci concerning for metastatic disease , mainly in the right fifth rib , left medial scapula , L4 and L5 vertebral bodies , right iliac wing , left greater trochanter and right femoral diathesis , ( 2 ) multiple foci of abnormal uptake in the left of L1 and L3 vertebral bodies likely due to arthritic disease .
ISSUES :
Metastatic cancer , origin unknown .
The patient 's left lower extremity had severe pain which rendered the patient immobile .
Oncology team was consulted and orthopedics team was consulted .
Oncology was consulted due to highly suspicious that lesion at left side and also lung is metastatic in nature and the origin of the cancer is unknown .

I personally interviewed and examined the patient today .
The patient continues to have significant lower abdominal pain .
It may be slightly better than yesterday , but it is still bothering her a lot .
She had about 4 bowel movements after laxatives .
She does not feel constipated today .
Her shortness of breath is also improved .
She is getting bronchodilators .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , she is alert and oriented .
Her blood pressures are generally low in the 80s to 90s systolic , pulse is stable , she is afebrile .
She is in mild respiratory distress at rest .
Chest ; she has bilateral wheezing mostly expiratory , but a lot better than on admission .
Heart ; regular rhythm .
Abdomen ; she does not have any tenderness .
Extremities ; there is no edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory tests were reviewed and electrolytes and renal function are normal .
Her hemoglobin is further down to 10.8 .
Her white count is normal .
PROBLEMS :
1. Abdominal aortic aneurysm .
Our working diagnosis is that she is having rupture of her abdominal aortic aneurysm .
We have discussed it with her .
She is not interested in surgery and at this time we would provide supportive care .
2. COPD .
Her COPD is better .
She would remain on bronchodilators .
3. Anemia .
She has dropped her blood count by about 3 units of hemoglobin , which is a significant amount of blood loss .
This is most likely in the retroperitoneum .
At this time , we will not plan any transfusions .

HISTORY
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old female patient known to Dr. **NAME[TTT] at the **INSTITUTION who was originally admitted through the emergency room of **STREET-ADDRESS **NAME[SSS] on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .
The patient lives at home by herself and is checked on routinely by neighbors and Meals On Wheels .
Neighbors found the patient seated on the floor in front of the couch upon their visit on the day of admission .
It was unknown how long the patient had been on the floor .
Paramedics were called and the patient was transferred to the emergency room at **STREET-ADDRESS **NAME[SSS] .
On discussion with the neighbors , it was discovered that this same incident occurred the day prior as well , only at this time the patient was found seated on the floor beside the bed .
Paramedics were called at this time as well and the patient refused treatment and transport at that time .
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was noted to be stable .
The patient denied any symptoms of light - headedness , dizziness , loss of consciousness , palpitations , fevers , or chills .
The patient had been suffering from congestion , rhinorrhea , and cough for the past several days .
She noted that she had been getting increasingly weak with this viral syndrome that she had been experiencing the past few days , but denied ever becoming light - headed , dizzy , or short of breath .
On admission workup , the patient was noted to have a white count of 14.8 and the remainder of her admission laboratory workup was negative .
Head CT was performed , which noted small vessel disease , mucosal changes in the sinuses , and no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or stroke .
A chest x-ray at that time was negative for any acute disease in the chest .
HOSPITAL COURSE
In light of this unwitnessed fall along with white count , dehydration , and weakness , the patient was admitted to **STREET-ADDRESS **NAME[SSS] for treatment of acute sinusitis .
She was initiated with a five-day course of azithromycin .
The patient was also rehydrated with IV fluids initially .
The patient responded well to antibiotic therapy and rehydration .
Physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted and it was felt that the patient would be a good candidate for acute rehab given the patient 's deconditioning and functional status .
The patient was adamant about wishing to return home in lieu of going to an outpatient rehab facility , skilled nursing facility , nursing home , or assisted living facility .
The patient was approved for acute inpatient rehab in 4A .
The patient was transferred there .

Brief Hospital Course :
Assessment :
68M with multiple vascular risk factors presents with acute onset right-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria , aphasia concerning for acute left MCA infarct .
Patient arrived in Daniel within 3 hours of symptom onset and head CT showed no evidence of bleed .
However , as wife had not seen patient before he became symptomatic , there was some concern that he had symptoms earlier than 6 am , and therefore would be outside the 3 hour window for TPA .
MRI was performed which showed diffusion abnormalities but no hyperintensity on T2 / FLAIR imaging supporting the acute onset .
Therefore , IV tpa thrombolytics were administered within 3 hours of symptom onset .
Within minutes the patient showed decreased right sided weakness and improved from a global aphasia to an anterior aphasia picture .
Given the likely embolic etiology of infarct , carotid doppler and TTE were performed .
Doppler revealed no hemodynamically significant lesions bilaterally .
Echo did not reveal potential source of emboli , but showed striking left ventricle akinesis and hypokinesis presumbly due to past MI x 2 .
Given that the stroke occurred while taking aspirin and plavix , and given the severe akinesis of the left ventricle , we decided to initiate anticoagulation with warfarin to help prevent future strokes .
Anticoagulation therapy was initiated with heparin and coumadin beginning on the evening of 2016-08-23 .
The patient and his wife , a nurse , were educated on low molecular wt heparin , which was started in the hospital on 2015-08-26 with close follow-up scheduled with Dr. Demmert of the Wareham VA primary care clinic the next morning .
His depakote was continued for his bipolar disorder .
On discharge , strength was nearly intact in the limbs , though he still had a right-sided facial droop .
Additionally , he still had mild dysarthria and mild anterior aphasia .
Additionally , risk factor modification was continued .
Lipid panel was checked and showed good control of lipids on his home dose of zocor .
Patient has no history of diabetes , and fasting glucose was 78 , but A1C was slightly elevated at 5.9 .
He may need further glucose monitoring in the future .
His home hypertensive medications were held while in the hospital to help increase cerebral perfusion and prevent further ischemia .
They will be restarted on discharge .
Speech therapy was also consulted , and recommended oupatient speech therapy .
Similarly , outpatient PT was recommended for his gait difficulties from his previous strokes .
Residual deficits include right side facial droop from previous stroke and moderately severe dysarthria and anterior aphasia with word finding difficulties .

Increased soft tissues within the pharynx .
This may be secondary to soft tissue swelling as indicated in the patient 's history , and some may be secondary to secretions above the ETT balloon .
No retropharyngeal fluid is identified .
Dependent atelectasis is present within the visualized portions of the lung apices .
2. Chest CT :
Bilateral lower lobe consolidations mostly in dependent portion , with small pleural effusion and diffuse ground-glass opacity in bilateral upper and lower lobes , consistent with ARDS with pulmonary edema given the history .
Ground-glass opacity is somewhat more prominent in right upper lobe , and superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded .
Brief Hospital Course :
This is a 39 year-old female with diabetes type I , hypothyroidism , gastroparesis who was transfered for hypoxic respiratory failure .
1. Hypoxic Rspiratory Failure :
She arrived intubated and sedated from Esteban Hospital .
On arrival a chest x-ray showed perihilar and bibasilar opacities , which appeared conistent with pulmonary edema but also possibly consistent with a pneumonia .
There was no evidence of ARDS .
She was known to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum at the outside hospital .
A bronchoscopy with BAL was performed and a sputum sample eventually grew out MRSA .
She was treated with vancomycin to cover her MRSA pneumonia .
A CT scan was performed on 07-17 to evaluate the soft tissue swelling seen on CT at the outside hospital .
The CT showed increased soft tissues within the pharynx which was felt to be secondary to prolonged intubation / trauma .
She was treated with steroids for this swelling at the outside hospital , and these were continued .
It was decided that patient should receive one more trial off the vent before committing her to a tracheotomy .
She did well on minimal vent settings but it was decided to delay extubating the patient until the morning of 6/2 .
Overnight , the patient became hypoxic , dropping to the 80 's .
A chest x-ray showed that the ET tube was displaced to very high in the trachea .
The cuff was deflated and the patient was extubated .
She was placed in supplemental oxygen by shovel mask and her sats immediately improved .
She was weaned down until she was maintaining her oxygen saturation above 90% on 6L by nasal cannuala .
As she was doing well without evidence of stridor , the steroids were stopped .
She did well and was weaned from supplemental oxygen .
At the time of discharge , she was oxygenating well on room air .
She Will need to complete a 14 day course of vancomycin for her MRSA pneumonia on 2019-07-30 .
2. Enterobacter bacteremia :
She was initially covered broadly with vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , and falgyl .
She had positive blood cultures at Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital for gram negative rods .
Subsequently , zosyn was added .
The cultures grew out enterobacter cloacae .
It was unclear the source of her bacteremia .
Her stool cultures were negative .
Her central line was removed and the tip was culture negative .
She was transitioned to on levofloxacin for her bacteremia .
She had no positive cultures during this admission .
Once she was more stable , an abdominal CT was performed to look for an abscess .
This study was negative .
However , the study was limited due to inadequate po contrast intake by the patient ; it did show a question of a cecal cystic lesion verse normal loop of bowel .
This study will need to be repeated once she is tolerating po 's .
She will complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin for her bacteremia on 2019-07-30 .
3. Diabetes type I :
She was intially maintained on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control .
She was followed by Albano during the admission .
She was initially maintained on D5W , which was increased to D10W as the patient was persistently borderline hypoglycemic while on insulin drip .
Once she began to take PO 's , the insulin drip was stopped and patient was started on glargine with a humalog sliding scale .
While her po intake was minimal she was maintained on supplemental IV dextrose to suppress ketosis .
While she was on the IV dextrose , she required up to 26 units of glargine for glycemic control .
As she starting taking some foods , her glargine was decrease .
At the time of discharge her glargine was 10 .
Her blood glucose were under good control .
The day prior to discharge , she was nauseated and not taking pos .
Therefore , she received 1L of D5 , and her sugars were elevated to 400 the day of discharge .
4. Gastroparesis :
She has a history of gastroparesis secondary to long-standing type I diabetes .
Once she was extubated , she was nauseated with emesis .
She was intially treated with erythromycin for pro-motility as she had a bad reaction to reglan in the past .
She continued to remained nauseated so she was treated with phenergan , anzemet , zofran , and ativan .
She intermittently was able tolerate pos .
Her nausea was accompanied by abdominal pain for which she was treated with morphine .
She was transitioned to a PCA for better pain control .
She continued to have nausea despite an agressive anti-emetic regimen .
It was felt that her symptoms were secondary to gastroparesis .
However , other causes were looked for including adrenal insufficiency and bowel obstruction .
She had a normal cortisol stimulation test .
A abdominal plain film showed non-specific bowel gas patterns that may represent an early obstruction .
A NG tube was placed for decompression given the signs of early obstruction the day of transfer .
The GI service was consulted and they felt that her symptoms were all gastroparesis .
They recommended erythromycin and zelnorm .
She should eventually have a tissue transglutaminase to rule out celiac disease .
5. Transaminitis :
Per report , She had elevated LFTs at the outside hospital .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed and was negative for any acute pathology .
Her LFTs trended down during this admission .
6. Hypothyroidism :
She was maintained on her levothyroxine .
While she was not taking adequate pos , she was on IV levothyroxine .
7. F/E/N :
She was NPO while intubated and recived tube feedings for nutrition .
After extubation , patient was started on sips and had a speech and swallow evaluation .
She was cleared to advance her diet as tolerated .
She only tolerated some clear liquids .
At the time of transfer , she was NPO given her NG tube .
8. Prophylaxis :
PPI , Heparin SQ .

INTERPRETATION :
Findings :
This study was compared to the prior study of 2017-06-01 .
LEFT ATRIUM :
Normal LA size .
LEFT VENTRICLE :
Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images .
Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size .
Suboptimal technical quality , a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded .
No resting LVOT gradient .
RIGHT VENTRICLE :
Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion .
AORTA :
Normal aortic root diameter .
Focal calcifications in aortic root .
AORTIC VALVE :
Normal aortic valve leaflets .
No AR .
MITRAL VALVE :
Normal mitral valve leaflets .
Mild ( 1+ ) MR .
TRICUSPID VALVE :
Mild PA systolic hypertension .
PERICARDIUM :
No pericardial effusion .
GENERAL COMMENTS :
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows .
Based on 1997 AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations , the echo findings indicate a low risk ( prophylaxis not recommended ).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data .
Conclusions :
The left atrium is normal in size .
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal .
Due to suboptimal technical quality , a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded .
Overall systolic function is good ( LVEF > 40% ).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion .
No aortic regurgitation is seen .
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal .
Mild ( 1+ ) mitral regurgitation is seen .
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
There is no pericardial effusion .
IMPRESSION :
Good global biventricular systolic function .
Mild mitral regurgitation .
The prior study of 2017-06-01 ( tape reviewed ) was of very suboptimal technical quality and not directly comparable to the current study .
If more definitive information regarding ventricualr fuynction is needed , a cardiac MRI ( ( 951 ) 247-0244 ) or radionuclide study is suggested .
Based on 1997 AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations , the echo findings indicate a low risk ( prophylaxis not recommended ).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS :
Left buttock hematoma .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :
1. Multiple myeloma , stage IIIB immunoglobulin M lambda .
2. Hypertension .
3. History of atrial fibrillation .
4. History of hyperlipidemia .
5. History of diverticulitis .
STUDIES / PROCEDURES :
1. Hematoma evacuation by orthopedic surgery , Dr. **NAME[VVV] was done on **DATE[Feb 12 2007] .
Irrigation and debridement of the left buttock hematoma .
2. Bilateral lower extremity Dopplers were done on **DATE[Feb 13 2007] , showing no evidence of DVT in either leg .
3. Lower extremity MRI of the left leg showing changes consistent with a partially evacuated hematoma .
No specific features of abscess , although superinfection could not be excluded on the basis of that imaging study .
There was moderate , strandy edema or hemorrhage within the adductor muscles and the posterior compartment .
Also , multiple foci of marrow replacement within the pelvis was seen , most likely related to the known multiple myeloma without pathologic fracture .
Chest x-ray on **DATE[Feb 11 2007] , showed no active disease .
**INSTITUTION ADMISSION :
This is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old man with a past medical history significant for stage IIIB immunoglobulin M lambda multiple myeloma who was admitted on **DATE[Feb 10 2007] , for an intramuscular hematoma while taking Lovenox after a bone marrow biopsy .
Bone marrow biopsy was done on **DATE[Feb 5 2007] .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Hematoma .
On admission , the patient has severe pain and limited range of motion at his left hip secondary to the left buttock hematoma .
Initially , the anticoagulation with Lovenox was stopped .
Pain was initially controlled with MS Contin and IV Dilaudid for breakthrough pain .
However , later , his pain required a Dilaudid PCA for optimal control .
The patient was seen by Dr. **NAME[VVV] from orthopedics on **DATE[Feb 11 2007] , and then taken to the OR on
**DATE[Feb 12 2007] , for evacuation of the hematoma .
His postoperative course was complicated by :
2. Series of fevers on day 1 postoperatively .
These were worked up with lower extremity Dopplers which were negative ; and MRI of the lower extremity which was also negative for any sort of abscess .
Dr. **NAME[UUU] from infectious diseases was also consulted , and intravenous antibiotics with Zosyn and vancomycin were also initiated .
However , all cultures were negative .
By postoperative day 2 to 3 , all of the fevers had resolved .
Therefore , the fever was likely due to postoperative atelectasis which is the most common cause of day 1 postoperative fever .
This was treated with incentive spirometry .
3. Infectious diseases .
As stated above , there was a question of an infected hematoma .
However , the MRI of the leg did not show any sort of abscess .
Dr. **NAME[UUU] from infectious diseases was consulted .
The patient was treated with IV Zosyn and vancomycin for 6 and 5 days respectively .
Cultures from the Hemovac and blood cultures all remained negative .
There was no other explanation for the fever .
There was no UTI .
The chest x-ray did not show any pneumonia .
On discharge , he was put on Augmentin for approximately 9 more days .
4. Multiple myeloma .
This was diagnosed in **DATE[Nov 2006] with a presentation of back pain and serum viscosity of 15 .
He received DT - PACE x 1 cycle with refractory disease , then 3 cycles of Velcade , thalidomide , and dexamethasone .
However , the thalidomide was held for two cycles secondary to atrial fibrillation .
The long - term plan is for autologous stem cell transplant .
This will be addressed as an outpatient by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] .
On this admission , his IgM was still high at 6240 .
Dr. **NAME[VVV] requests that chemotherapy with Velcade be held until after his office appointment in approximately 2 weeks in order to monitor the progress of the evacuation of the hematoma prior to restarting chemotherapy .
5. Cardiovascular. Dr. **NAME[TTT] with cardiology was consulted for clearance prior to autologous stem cell transplant .
The patient had not been in atrial fibrillation since thalidomide had been discontinued and a recent stress test from an outside hospital was negative for ischemia and had normal wall motion .
Therefore , Dr. **NAME[TTT] cleared Mr. **NAME[CCC] for stem cell transplant once these acute issues have resolved .
His atenolol was continued throughout hospitalization .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily .
2. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily .
3. Lipitor 40 mg p.o. nightly .
4. Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.8 h .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Kacholera Junk was a 34 year old gentleman with no significant past medical history except for a history of of intravenous drug abuse .
He was status post a rehabilitation hospitalization at the Raya Ma Den Erinmarg Hospital with a recent recrudescence of his drug abuse .
He was admitted to the Sephsandpot Center on the morning of 4/9 and was subsequently transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further care .
The patient was apparently well until one day prior to admission .
His family reports that he had worked that day .
He relates using large doses of Cocaine and Heroin early in the morning on the day of admission .
At 3:00 a.m. on the day of admission he was found by the emergency medical technicians &quot; crawling on all fours &quot; , confused , and combative outside his home .
He gave an equivocal history of fevers and chills on the days prior to admission .
Bystanders report that he was assaulted about 20 minutes earlier and the nature of the assault was not known .
He was taken to the Sephsandpot Center where he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 105/85 , tachycardic with a heart rate to 186 , aneuric , hyperthermic , with a temperature to 105 degrees F , and progressively more confused .
His chest x-ray was clear .
He was treated with Dopamine for hypertension and Inderal for tachycardia .
He received two amps of Narcan .
He received one gram of Ceftriaxone intravenously after blood cultures were drawn .
His initial arterial blood gas at the Sephsandpot Center revealed a p02 of 76 , pC02 14 , and a pH of 7.44 on room air .
He was then transferred via Med Flight to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
He denied any history of recent travel .
Toxicology screen at Sephsandpot Center revealed Cocaine and Quinine .
Shortly after his arrival to that hospital he had been intubated for a respiratory rate of 60 .
He required medical paralysis for this .
He was reported to have a seizure , although the nature of this was unclear , and received Valium for this .

No peripheral edema was noted .
The jugular venous pressure was not assessed secondary to cervical collar being in place .
The carotid pulses were brisk bilaterally .
The vascular exam showed normal pulses bilaterally without bruits .
The abdomen was soft , bowel sounds of normal character , and there was mild percussion tenderness and tenderness to modest palpation in all four quadrants .
It was unclear whether this was due to superficial tenderness or abdominal tenderness .

LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , BUN 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 .
The SGOT was 994 , LDH 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 .
Lactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4. The white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations .
Hematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 .
The MCV is 88 .
The prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 .
The urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , pH 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 RBCs and 3-5 WBCs .
The CK was 17,890 with 0.6% MB .
The urine sodium was 147 .
The serum toxicology was positive for Cocaine on admission to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital as well as the Sephsandpot Center .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged QT at 0.572 .
An I-head CT revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages .
The abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .
Chest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .
He was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .
1-Rhabdomyolysis .
The patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .
This resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .
The patient &apos;s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .
The aldolase was positive at 142 .
This was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The patient &apos;s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .
The patient &apos;s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .
Nevertheless , the patient &apos;s renal failure continued to progress .
Over the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .
Much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .
2-Renal failure .
The creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .
The urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .
Peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .
Subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .
He continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .
3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .
On admission the patient &apos;s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .
He went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .
The patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .
His DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .
4-Septic shock .
The patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .
He was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .
Hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .
He had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .
This will be discussed below .
Further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .
An echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .
His ejection fraction was 55% .
On 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .
5-Hepatic failure .
His SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .
He had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .
He was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .
Given his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .
6-Cocaine intoxication .
Serum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
Further , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .
This is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .
7-Pneumonia .
The patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .
The first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .
He subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .
He was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .
8-Pancreatitis .
The amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .
Although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .
9-Catheter tip infections .
The patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .
These were treated with Vancomycin .
10-Anemia .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .
11-Coma .
The patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .
A CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .
The lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient &apos;s persistent coagulopathy .
The patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .
Further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .
Despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .
Mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .
The patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .
Nevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :

DISCHARGE DATE :
**DATE[May 23 2007]
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Fever of uncertain etiology .
2. Chronic granulomatous disease .
3. Constipation .
CONSULTS :
1. Infectious Disease .
2. Pulmonary Medicine .
3. General Surgery .
STUDIES COMPLETED :
1. Multiple chest x-rays on admission on **DATE[May 12 2007] , chest x-ray showed chronic changes in the lung bases .
No pleural effusion .
2. On **DATE[May 18 2007] , CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showing slight decrease in lingular nodules since **DATE[May 19 2006] , stable to decreasing hypodense hepatic foci at least a portion of which may be scarring , no evidence of active inflammatory process or significant ascites .
3. On **DATE[May 19 2007] , bronchoscopy with BAL .
HISTORY :
The patient is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old white male who presented to **INSTITUTION 's ED on **DATE[May 17 2007] , complaining of several - day history of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting as well as generalized malaise .
He has a past medical history of chronic granulomatous disease , recurrent Aspergillus pneumonia , liver abscess with Staphylococcus aureus , and recent discharge with the diagnosis of possible fungal pneumonia .
In the ED , he denied fever , chills , melena , chest pain , palpitations , and myalgias .
He had been off his prophylactic Bactrim for approximately a week when he was discharged from a week ago , he was instructed to go to the bronch lab and get a BAL .
Unfortunately when he called to make this appointment , they had no record of him .
Laboratory data showed a sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 105 , CO2 24 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1 , and glucose 77 .
White count 8.9 , hemoglobin 12 , hematocrit 37 , platelet count 295 , 85 neutrophils , 12 lymphocytes , 2 monocytes , lipase 177 , total bilirubin 1 , ALT 36 , AST 76 , alkaline phosphatase 87 , and GGTP 32 .
Incidentally , we did consult General Surgery , as there was a concern that he may have an acute abdomen .
We did evaluate the patient following his CT scan and did serial exams , and they felt that he did not have any acute surgical issues .
In regards to his abdominal pain , our differential diagnosis was broad at first .
We thought that he could very well still be constipated versus viral bacterial gastroenteritis versus appendicitis or worsening of his liver abscess .
Although clinically , he did not appear to be septic , overnight on his first hospital night , he developed a fever of 40.1 with severe chills and rigors .
At this point , we consulted Infectious Disease .
We did pan culture him with blood cultures , urine cultures , stool cultures , and eventually a bronchoscopy with BAL .
At this point in time clinically , he did not appear well , and he was started on IV vancomycin and Unasyn as well as continuing his itraconazole .
We did check a CT scan of his chest , abdomen , and pelvis , and as mentioned above , it only showed a modestly improved hepatic abscess .
None of his cultures grew out either .
Over the course of the next 24 to 48 hours clinically , he improved dramatically .
He was afebrile , feeling much better and had an appetite .
His white blood cell count did come down as well .
With this chronic granulomatous disease , it is difficult to analyze his blood work , as he may not have leukocytosis .
The final recommendations from Infectious Disease are to complete a total of a 2 - week course of IV vancomycin and Unasyn IV .
Once that is completed , he should start on oral cefadroxil and rifampin .
All the while , he should continue with his Bactrim and itraconazole .
Furthermore , we will schedule him for repeat CT scan of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis and then see Dr. **NAME[PPP] in Infectious Disease in approximately 4 weeks .
From a pulmonary standpoint , again he had been off his Bactrim so he could have a BAL to evaluate a pulmonary nodule as well as his pneumonias .
Pulmonary Medicine was consulted and did complete a bronchoscopy with BAL .
At the time of this dictation , his cultures have all been negative .
They were quite adamant that he did not have any clinical symptoms suggestive of pneumonia .
We did obtain an abdominal x-ray on the patient that did show severe constipation , but no obstruction .
He was not having bowel movements with Colace and Senokot .
Therefore , we did try mag citrate for several days per the recommendation of General Surgery .
He then started to have loose stools .
We have instructed him at home to eat a high - fiber diet with fruits and vegetables as well as taking in water .
We will instruct him to use Colace and Senokot as needed for constipation in the future .
Again the stool cultures we did receive back on **DATE[May 18 2007] , were negative for Salmonella , Shigella , Campylobacter , C. difficile , and white blood cells .
Overall , the patient has been doing much better .
He has been afebrile , hemodynamically stable and overall feeling better .
He does have an appetite .

ALT 27 , AST 21 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , total bilirubin 1.2 , amylase 47 .
The U/A was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred for cardiac catheterization .
Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 45% , right dominant coronary artery system with occlusive single vessel disease of the LAD .
Multiple wires were used to attempt to cross the total occlusion , but were ultimately unsuccessful .
The patient was continued on a heparin drip for atrial fibrillation .
Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation was obtained and the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2010-03-12 for coronary artery bypass grafting times two ; LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery .
Subsequent to this , the patient was transferred to the CRSU for closer monitoring .
He was deemed to be too lethargic and sleepy to be extubated on postoperative day number zero .
The patient was extubated early on postoperative day number one without significant complication .
He remained in atrial fibrillation .
The EP Service was consulted regarding the patient 's atrial fibrillation .
This was his main issue in the postoperative course .
He was attempted on multiple different drugs including Procainamide , Diltiazem , Esmolol , Sotalol , Amiodarone .
The patient was kept therapeutically anticoagulated throughout this period .
The patient was also started on digoxin .
Ultimately , the patient was transferred to the floor and anticoagulation with Coumadin was begun .
The patient arrived on the floor with medications as follows :
Sotalol 180 mg b.i.d. , Diltiazem 90 mg q.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
While the patient was awaiting therapeutic anticoagulation with Coumadin , he spontaneously converted into normal sinus rhythm .
The patient was found to have a resting heart rate of approximately 50 subsequent to this .
In consultation with the EP Service , Diltiazem was stopped .
After approximately 24 hours , the patient converted back into atrial fibrillation and Diltiazem was restarted at 60 mg q.i.d.
The patient then had one more episode where he was converted to normal sinus rhythm but this lasted only a few hours before reverting back to atrial fibrillation .
The patient was ultimately discharged on postoperative day number 16 , tolerating a regular diet , and adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications , having no anginal symptoms and with an INR of 2.0 .
The patient failed multiple attempts at cardioversion .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :

ADDENDUM :
The patient was to be discharged from the hospital on **DATE[May] __________ , 2007 .
He went to IR for a PICC line placement for outpatient antibiotics .
While on venogram , a subclavian thrombus was visualized .
At that time , we started the patient on a heparin drip and monitored his INR .
We wanted to reach an INR of 2.0 prior to discharge .
We thought that we would be able to send the patient home with Lovenox and Coumadin .
However , the patient developed acute renal failure .
His creatinine had increased to 1.8 .
For that reason , we maintained the patient on heparin and Coumadin __________ .
As mentioned , his creatinine had increased to 1.8 .
We got a renal ultrasound that was normal .
We continued to hydrate the patient .
However , his creatinine remained elevated .
We consulted Renal Service to help us with his evaluation .
Their recommendation was to if okay with Infectious Disease to discontinue the Bactrim to see if he would have a drop in his creatinine .
Once off the Bactrim , his creatinine slowly trended back to normal .
As part of his evaluation , he did have a urine eosinophil sent and this was negative .
On **DATE[May 23 2007] , once his creatinine was back to normal , we spoke with Renal , and they said that it was okay for us to start him on Lovenox .
It will be important that we watch his BUN and creatinine while he is still on Lovenox .
While here , the patient continued to have this persistent abdominal pain .
He did not have any fevers or chills at this time , however , had continued nausea .
We did an abdominal film on **DATE[May 28 2007] , and he had stool throughout his GI track .
He was put on a bowel regimen with good outcome .
We also had General Surgery evaluated the patient as well .
We had a CT scan done on **DATE[May 29 2007] , that showed just a resolving abscess .
The spleen , kidney , and pancreas and visualized bowel were normal .
Because this abdominal pain really never went away , and we reconsulted GI .
They reported that with CGD you can sometimes have granulomatous infiltration of the GI tract .
It is somewhat reported about 33% of the patients with CGD .
They said that this was can only be confirmed through a colonoscopy with biopsy .
His last colonoscopy was in **DATE[May 2006] , and was normal except for showing some internal hemorrhoid .
A repeat colonoscopy was done on **DATE[Jun 1 2007] , that was normal .
A biopsy was taken at this time and is still pending .
Their recommendation was to allow the patient to advance his diet .
On **DATE[May 30 2007] , the patient developed fever to 38.6 .
It was an isolated fever .
At that time , we really did not have any etiology .
We did blood cultures on that day and they were negative x 3 days .
We also had a second set of cultures done on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] , and these were negative x 1 day .
We did really not have a reason for his fever , and he has been afebrile in the past 48 hours .
For final recommendations by Infectious Disease , we discontinued his vancomycin on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .
We kept the Zosyn and then on **DATE[Jun 3 2007] , discontinued the Zosyn , and we will start ceftriaxone .
He will resume his rifampin which was started on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .
He would not require any IV antibiotics at discharge .
Abdominal pain :
After the colonoscopy , the patient said that he had increased pain after this procedure .
We discussed this with General Surgery .
They evaluated the patient and ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out any free air or bleeding .
__________ this was negative .
GI recommended another abdominal film that showed a gas - filled colon that is expected following a colonoscopy .
The patient had decreasing white count since admission .
As expected with his infection , his white count was 10.6 on admission .
However after his antibiotics , his white count came down between 4 and 5 .
Around **DATE[Jun 1 2007] , his white count dropped from 4.4 down to 2.3 .
At the same time , his absolute neutrophils had gone from the 2 to 3 range , on **DATE[Jun 3 2007] , down to 0.80 .
This may have been caused by the vancomycin or the Zosyn .
__________ recommendations to see if the absolute neutrophil count increases after the patient is offered the vancomycin and Zosyn for a day or two .
We have placed the patient in neutropenic precautions until we see this level increased .
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS :
1. Primary care physician , Dr. **NAME[RRR] in 9 South Montefiore on **DATE[Jun 27 2007] , at 10:30 a.m. , **PHONE .
2. CT scan is changed to **DATE[Jun 27 2007] , at 12:46 .
3. Dr. **NAME[QQQ] on **DATE[Jun 27 2007] , at 1:30 ( the CT scan appointment had changed to ensure the patient has his CT scan prior to seeing Dr. **NAME[QQQ] ) .
NOTATION :
The patient had received Compazine during this stay for nausea .
However after having the Compazine , the patient felt very anxious and felt palpitations .
We changed him back to the Phenergan that he was on and will not want a substitution for the Compazine .
A complete list of the discharge medications on the day of discharge will be added to this .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 19 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Dec 23 07]
I am managing this critically - ill , **AGE[in 40s]- year - old gentleman with several complications arising from his severe biliary pancreatitis , the most recent procedure for debridement of a necrotic gallbladder , placement of a PTC catheter , repair of SMA pseudoaneurysm .
He is suffering from ARDS , malnutrition and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the Vascular and General Surgery Team , as well as the Critical Care house staff .
The problems of my management are as follows :
1. Pancreatitis .
The patient is on Oxepa through the J tube and he seems to be tolerating the tube feeds at the moment , and they are also refeeding his PTC drainage back into his tube feeds to prevent excessive biliary losses .
2. Respiratory failure .
The patient was placed yesterday on pressure support ventilation .
He tolerated that fairly well and this morning , his pressure settings are 10/5 and today I will try to switch him to 5/5 with a goal of extubating the patient .
3. Hypertension .
The patient seems to be still resistant to multiple medications for the management of his blood pressure and his systolic blood pressures were as high as 173 ____________ of four hours .
Today , I will increase the doses on Lopressor and captopril before adding a new agent and I am planning to use clonidine as an additive agent if need be .
4. Malnutrition .
The patient is on Oxepa at the moment and still at low serum albumins .
I am planning to continue with his tube feeds started and over a long course , I think he will catch up with his caloric intake and he will build up new protein and muscle bulk .
5. Infectious issues .
The patient is currently on linezolid and meropenem for the positive cultures for Pseudomonas and enterococci and we will follow our course with the antibiotics .
6. ICU prophylaxis .
The patient ___________ prophylaxis with Pepcid and he is on heparin infusion for DVT prophylaxis as well as for the maintenance of the SMA graft and he is on a sliding scale insulin for blood glucose management .
The total critical care time spent was 37 minutes .

**DATE[Jun 05 2007]
ADDENDUM
The patient was to be discharged from the hospital on **DATE[May 23 2007] or **DATE[May 24 2007] .
He went to IR for a PICC line placement for outpatient antibiotics .
While on venogram , a subclavian thrombus was visualized .
At that time , we started the patient on a heparin drip and monitored his INR .
We wanted to reach an INR of 2.0 prior to discharge .
We thought that we would be able to send the patient home with Lovenox and Coumadin .
However , the patient developed acute renal failure .
His creatinine had increased to 1.8 .
For that reason , we maintained the patient on heparin and Coumadin firmly .
As mentioned , his creatinine had increased to 1.8 .
We got a renal ultrasound that was normal .
We continued to hydrate the patient .
However , his creatinine remained elevated .
We consulted Renal Service to help us with his evaluation .
Their recommendation was , if okay with Infectious Disease , to discontinue the Bactrim to see if he would have a drop in his creatinine .
Once off the Bactrim , his creatinine slowly trended back to normal .
As part of his evaluation , he did have a urine eosinophil sent and this was negative .
On **DATE[May 23 2007] , once his creatinine was back to normal , we spoke with Renal , and they said that it was okay for us to start him on Lovenox .
It will be important that we watch his BUN and creatinine while he is still on the Lovenox .
While here , the patient continued to have this persistent abdominal pain .
He did not have any fevers or chills at this time , however , had continued nausea .
We did an abdominal film on **DATE[May 28 2007] , and he had stool throughout his GI track .
He was put on a bowel regime with good outcome .
We also had General Surgery evaluate the patient as well .
We had a CT scan done on **DATE[May 29 2007] , that showed just a resolving abscess .
The spleen , kidney , and pancreas and the visualized bowel were normal .
Because this abdominal pain really never went away , we reconsulted GI .
They reported that with CGD you can sometimes have granulomatous infiltration of the GI tract .
It is somewhat reported in about 33% of the patients with CGD .
They said that this can only be confirmed through a colonoscopy with biopsy .
His last colonoscopy was in **DATE[May 2006] , and was normal except for showing some internal hemorrhoid .
A repeat colonoscopy was done on **DATE[Jun 1 2007] , that was normal .
A biopsy was taken at this time and is still pending .
Their recommendation was to allow the patient to advance his diet .
On **DATE[May 30 2007] , the patient developed fever to 38.6 .
It was an isolated fever .
At that time , we really did not have an etiology .
We did blood cultures on that day and they were negative x 3 days .
We also had a second set of cultures done on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] , and these were negative x 1 day .
We did really not have a reason for his fever , and he has been afebrile in the past 48 hours .
For final recommendations by Infectious Disease , we discontinued his vancomycin on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .
We kept the Zosyn and then on **DATE[Jun 3 2007] , discontinued the Zosyn , and we will start ceftriaxone .
He will resume his rifampin , which was started on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .
He would not require any IV antibiotics at discharge .
Abdominal pain :
After the colonoscopy , the patient said that he had increased pain after this procedure .
We discussed this with General Surgery .
They evaluated the patient and ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out any free air or bleeding .
This was negative .
GI recommended another abdominal film that showed a gas - filled colon that is expected following a colonoscopy .
The patient had decreasing white count since admission .
As expected with his infection , his white count was 10.6 on admission .
However , after his antibiotics , his white count came down between 4 and 5 .
Around **DATE[Jun 1 2007] , his white count dropped from 4.4 down to 2.3 .
At the same time , his absolute neutrophils had gone from the 2 to 3 range , on **DATE[Jun 3 2007] , down to 0.80 .
This may have been caused by the vancomycin or the Zosyn .
The recommendation is to see if the absolute neutrophil count increases after the patient is offered the vancomycin and Zosyn for a day or two .
We have placed the patient in neutropenic precautions until we see this level increase .
FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS :
1. Primary care physician , Dr. **NAME[RRR] in 9 South Montefiore on **DATE[Jun 27 2007] , at 10:30 a.m. , **PHONE .
2. CT scan is changed to **DATE[Jun 27 2007] , at 12:46 .
3. Dr. **NAME[QQQ] on **DATE[Jun 27 2007] , at 1:30 ( the CT scan appointment had changed to ensure the patient has a CT scan prior to seeing Dr. **NAME[QQQ] ) .
NOTATION :
The patient had received Compazine during this stay for nausea .
However , after having the Compazine , the patient felt very anxious and felt palpitations .
We changed him back to the Phenergan that he was on and will not want a substitution for the Compazine .
A completed list of the discharge medications on the day of discharge will be added to this .

Brief Hospital Course :
Mrs. Mandelbaum was admitted and underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Larry Mckinney .
Of note , intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram evaluation showed only mild mitral regurgitation , so no repair/replacement was indicated .
Following the operation , she was brought to the CSRU .
On postoperative day one , she was noted to be largely unresponsive with left hemiparesis .
Restlessness with body tremors were also noted .
A stat MRI was notable for multiple abnormal foci consistent with systemic emboli .
These were found in the right cerebellar , occipital and anterior parietal lobes .
The neurology service was consulted and attributed these findings to cholesterol emboli .
Due to seizure activity , Dilantin was started .
Anticoagulation was not recommended .
Over the next several days , her neurological status slowly improved .
She was eventually extubated without incident .
She went on to experience paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which was initially treated with intravenous Amiodarone .
She concomitantly had loose stools which were C. diff negative .
Her clinical status stablized and she transferred to the step down unit on postoperative day six .
She remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm and transitioned to oral Amiodarone which will need to continue for three months postop .
She tolerated beta blockade which was slowly advanced as tolerated .
She worked daily with physical and occupational therapy .
Her neurological status continued to improve .
Acyclovir was eventually increased from her maintenance dose for a herpes zoster breakout on her right upper back .
In addition , she was empirically started on Flagyl for persistent diarrhea ( despite negative C. diff cultures ) , however she developed an additional rash on her buttocks after the first dose of flagyl , so the flagyl was discontinued .
She developed a urinary tract infection for which she was started on Bactrim .
A foley catheter was inserted given her mutiple episodes of incontinence that were adding to skin irritation .
On insertion she was found to be retaining 1400 cc of urine , so the foley catheter was left in .
She continued to make clinical improvements and was cleared for discharge to rehab on postoperative day 10 .

Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
7-2-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
7-30-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Severe blunt abdominal trauma .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Grade II / V laceration of liver ,
2. rupture of left renal vein ,
3. tear of transverse mesocolon ,
4. serosal tear of transverse colon ,
5. blunt fracture of the neck of the pancreas .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Breath was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver .
The patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over , possibly over him .
He was found awake at the scene , complaining of abdominal pain .
He had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the Giles Min General Hospital crew .
Intravenous fluids was given .
He was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated , and a 14 gauge catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds .
He arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital at 02:30 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 .
Large bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins , bilateral chest tubes were placed , and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid .
He had an ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended .
His hematocrit was 36 , and creatinine 1.6 .
The abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood .
His blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as he was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table ; the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .
At laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .
There was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .
Control of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided &quot; Mattox &quot; maneuvers were performed .
The retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .
This was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .
The vein was divided and suture ligated .
Bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .
The tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .
The examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .
The patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer &apos;s lactate .
An intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .
Intracranial pressures were normal .
That day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .
An arch aortogram was normal .
Over the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .
The patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .
He was returned to the operating room on July 4 .
Three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .
Exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .
Because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .
Four large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .
The patient &apos;s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .
However , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .
He was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .
Continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient &apos;s course .
Vancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .
He was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .
Total parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .
Initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .
The patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .
It was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .
The abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .
He was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .
Tracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .
There was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .
The subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .
On July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .
On July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .
His blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Severe blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,

NOTE :
The Discharge Date of 2013-09-17 is pending .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Briefly , this 68 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease , diabetes mellitus , peripheral vascular disease , was admitted originally to the Podiatry Service for a left patellar mid-foot ulcer .
He underwent angiogram on 2013-08-28 , to evaluate his circulation and found at that time that the patient had a poor circulation to the left leg .
The patient was transferred to the Vascular Surgery Service for bilateral iliac stenting at that time .
The patient also at that time was followed by Cardiology and for preoperative evaluation had a stress test which was positive and he became diaphoretic but denied any chest pain .
Atropine was given and heart rate returned to the 70s and his blood pressure returned to the 120s over 80s .
The patient denied any orthopnea , shortness of breath , chest pain , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or cough .
He had occasional leg swelling .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1 . Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in 2006 and 1997 and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty times two .
2. Diabetes mellitus type 2 since age 25 ; now currently on insulin , which is complicated by peripheral neuropathy , nephropathy and Charcot 's foot .
3. Chronic renal insufficiency .
4. Peripheral vascular disease status post left iliac stent and right femoral stent .
5. Hypertension .
6. High cholesterol .
7. Question of tendonitis .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Insulin 70/30 , 40 units q. a.m. and 40 units q. p.m.
2. Diovan 160 mg p.o. q. day .
3. Nortriptyline 25 mg p.o. q. h.s.
4. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q. day .
5. Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. twice a day .
6. Hydrochlorothiazide , 15 mg p.o. q. day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile ; his vital signs were stable .
His neck was supple ; he had no jugular venous distention .
His carotids were two plus bilaterally without bruits .
His lungs were clear .
His heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
His abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Bowel sounds are present .
He had bilateral femoral bruits and he had one plus popliteal pulses .
His pedal pulses are absent .
LABORATORY :
On admission , his BUN was 13 , creatinine 1.7 , hematocrit 43 and the cholesterol was 208 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is admitted to this hospital through the Podiatry Service ; however , the stress test showed multi-vessel disease .
Podiatry continued to follow for evaluation of his left foot ulcer .
At the time of discharge , he was having acetic acid wet-to-dry dressing changes , 0.25% q. day .
Vascular Surgery was following at the same time and decided that bilateral iliac stenting would be the most optimum treatment currently and suggested that the patient should be worked up for cardiac disease prior to re-vascularization .
Medicine was also consulted at that time for high blood pressure and for the biceps pain .
While having angiography , he had a transient increase in his blood pressure and became diaphoretic and thus precipitated the evaluation for cardiac disease .
Cardiology was consulted at that time to evaluate his heart .
The patient was managed on the Medical Service for his drop in blood pressure and cardiac evaluation .
He was also followed by Podiatry and Vascular Surgery .
He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory which showed multi-vessel disease and Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted .
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2013-09-04 , where a coronary artery bypass graft times four was performed , left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to diagonal , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to PC by Dr. Wright .
The patient was transferred to the CSRU postoperatively where he did well .
He was slowly weaned from his ventilator and was able to be extubated .
The patient was able to be weaned to six liters nasal cannula after extubation , however , it was noted on chest x-ray that he had a small apical pneumothorax .
A repeat chest x-ray showed resolution of that pneumothorax .
The patient was continued on an insulin drip for his diabetes mellitus but continued to improve .
His chest tube was in place for a high chest tube output .
His Foley catheter was removed and the patient was transferred to the Floor .
Physical Therapy was consulted in order to assess the patient 's ambulation and mobility , however , with his foot infection and associated pain , it was difficult to assess at that time .
After arriving on the Floor , the patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and Lopressor .
The patient resolved , however , Lasix was also given due to some pulmonary edema and increasing oxygen need .
The patient continued to have episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation while on the Floor , which required continued diuresis as well as intravenous Lopressor .
His chest tube and Foley catheter were removed on postoperative day number three , and the patient had aggressive chest Physical Therapy and nebulizer treatments .
His dressing changes for his foot continued per the Podiatry Service and his leg ulcer was noted to be slowly healing .
The patient had multiple episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation which again required intravenous Lopressor .
Amiodarone boluses were given and the patient was started on 400 three times a day of p.o. amiodarone , aggressive pulmonary toilet and continued diuresis was done , however , the patient continued to have respiratory difficulties when in rapid atrial fibrillation .
The patient was evaluated on postoperative day number five and it was decided at that time that the patient should be transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory difficulties .
He was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where he was aggressively diuresed as well as his rate was controlled and chest Physical Therapy and nebulizer treatments were done .
The patient improved slowly .
Also , his white blood cell count was found to rise to 32.0 ; this was most likely due to a secondary infection of his foot and Zosyn was started .
The patient continued to do well and his recurrent atrial fibrillation slowly improved ; p.o. doses of Lopressor slowly increased to get better control of his rate and the patient was able to be controlled with a heart rate in the 50s to 60s with Lopressor .
Following initiation of his Zosyn , the white count continued to improve and the patient was planned for a PICC line for long-term intravenous antibiotics .
The patient was started on Lopressor 75 mg p.o. twice a day with good control with a heart rate of 50s to 60s .
He is in sinus rhythm .
He was also started on his preoperative medications of Amlodipine and Losartan with improvement of his blood pressure .
The patient was also reduced to 400 mg q. day of amiodarone .
Pulmonary was consulted at this time for this difficulty of diuresis and pulmonary edema .
They continued to agree with the management of the patient and with aggressive pulmonary toilet as well as diuresis and nebulizer treatment .
The patient was transferred back from the Intensive Care Unit on 2013-09-13 , and upon arriving on the floor , he continued to do well .
Pulmonary toilet and aggressive chest Physical Therapy was continued and the patient was able to be weaned from his oxygen .
Furthermore , his Foley catheter was removed and he was started on anti-coagulation for his episodes of atrial fibrillation .
He had been started on heparin in the Intensive Care Unit and that was continued .
Coumadin was then begun with a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
At that time he was stabilized from a cardiac perspective .
Podiatry and Vascular Surgery were reconsulted to assess the patient 's needs for revascularization and for his foot ulcer .
It was decided at that time that the patient could be discharged in follow-up with Vascular Surgery for revascularization and Podiatry thereafter .
On 2013-08-28 , the patient had a PICC line placed for a six week course of intravenous Zosyn for his foot ulcer and his Coumadin was also continued .
The patient did well and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility at that time .
His discharge date is pending .
CURRENT DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Regular insulin sliding scale .
2. Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. for an INR goal of 2.0 to 3.0 and adjust the dose accordingly .

**INSTITUTION COURSE :
Ms. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 40s]- year - old female with a history of hepatitis C and pulmonary fibrosis secondary to interferon treatment who was admitted from **INSTITUTION with a chief complaint of shortness of breath .
During her admission to the outside hospital , she was noted to have pneumonia and was started on IV Zosyn and IV vancomycin for this .
In addition , she was noted to be lethargic .
For her pneumonia , we maintained her on her IV Zosyn and IV vancomycin .
She remained afebrile during her stay here .
He blood cultures showed no growth .
She was initially on 4 to 10 liters of oxygen by Oxymizer .
However , on the day of transfer , she was weaned down to 2 L of O2 by nasal cannula .
A sputum culture was ordered but was not able to be obtained .
For her pulmonary fibrosis , she was maintained on oxygen .
The patient noticed a slight improvement in her shortness of breath by the time of transfer .
She was started on albuterol , Atrovent , Imuran , and Pulmicort .
Her lethargy was thought to be secondary to narcotic overdose at the outside hospital .
While there , she received IV Dilaudid .
Upon admission to **INSTITUTION , we stopped her Dilaudid and gradually decreased her OxyContin .
By the time of discharge , she was taking 30 mg of OxyContin by mouth every 12 hours with 5 mg of oxycodone p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n. breakthrough pain .
Following a decrease of her pain medications as well as her Ativan , her mental status greatly improved .
On the day of transfer , she was sitting up in bed and was able to walk around the hallways .
She was also seen by Dr. **NAME[UUU] ( GI ) for her hepatitis and history of ascites .
We obtained ammonia levels which were slightly elevated ( from 51.9 to 97.2 ) .
Her decreased level of consciousness was not thought to be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy .
She was maintained on a low-protein diet .
She was also started on Aldactone , Lasix , lactulose , and Neomycin .
Her Aldactone was stopped by GI on the day of transfer .
At the time of transfer , the patient reports that she is still having occasional diarrhea .
For prophylaxis , she was started on SCD s as well as Protonix .
She was followed by physical therapy and occupational therapy .
For her pain , she was continued on OxyContin and oxycodone .

PROBLEMS :
1. Abdominal pain .
2. Presacral abdominal mass on CT .
3. Hyponatremia .
4. Hypokalemia .
5. Chronic pain .
6. Urinary tract infection .
The patient is a **AGE[in 30s]- year - old Caucasian female who was admitted to the CCU on account of excessive abdominal pain .
The patient has a previous history of cervical cancer , for which she had surgery and radiotherapy at **INSTITUTION .
On this admission , she had a CT done , which showed that she had a presacral mass , which was also present on the previous CT in **DATE[Oct] .
The mass , however , seemed to have increased in size , and Dr. **NAME[TTT] was consulted for the mass and for abdominal pain .
She had a CT - guided biopsy of the mass , and this was done today .
Results will need to be followed for continuation of management .
Dr. **NAME[UUU] also saw the patient .
He is an oncologist who thinks the patient might need to be referred back to her previous oncologist .
He also said that if it is cervical cancer , then nothing much will be done in terms of chemotherapy .
She would probably need surgery or radiation therapy .
However , that will be dependent on cytologic findings .
The patient was also treated for a urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin .
She has a history of VRE in the urine ; however , we are still awaiting sensitivity pattern .
WBC , however , is improving .
At presentation , she also had severe hypokalemia with a value of 2.2 .
This has been corrected .
The value this morning was 4.4 .
The plan is to continue her on oral supplements .
We think her source of hypokalemia and hyponatremia is the colostomy which she has .
Overall , she is considered clinically stable to be transferred to a regular floor bed for continuation of management .

The patient was CMED-flighted to Quincy Medical Center , and he was intubated upon arrival in the Emergency Department .
After initial trauma assessment and initiation of resuscitation , a CT scan was performed .
Images of his head , abdomen , and thorax were obtained .
His injuries included bilateral zygomal and orbital rim fractures , a right temporal fracture , bilateral frontal contusions , and a right temporal epidural versus subdural hematoma .
The anterior and posterior of the frontal sinus was fractured with communication with the ethmoid air cells , presumably caused air in the orbit .

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
Initial examination revealed the patient had a heart rate in the 80s , with a blood pressure of 150/80s .
He was intubated with multiple abrasions , and severe swelling and contusions of his face .
He was not following commands .
His Boston Coma Scale was 16 .
His pupils were reactive on the right going from 3 mm to 2 mm of light .
The response was brisk .
On the left , his pupils went from 2.5 mm to 2 mm , also brisk .
Initial evaluation revealed corticate posturing was noted by the trauma team .
He withdrew equally and purposefully after 20 minutes in the trauma bay .
He withdrew to noxious stimuli equally and purposefully after 20 minutes in the trauma bay .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. NEUROLOGY :
Mr. Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay .
Upon arrival , Neurosurgery promptly placed V. Holtzen bolt .
This allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure .
Notably , intracranial pressure was 17 when the bolt was placed .
During his hospitalization , his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than 20 .
To do this , mannitol 25 mg q. 6h. was used .
While using mannitol , his serum osmolalities were followed closely .
In addition , to monitoring his intracranial pressure , his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg .
A parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO2 which was maintained between 35 and 40 during his hospitalization .
Mr. Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and / or morphine boluses for pain .
Neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination .
During his hospitalization , two subsequent CAT scans were obtained ; one on hospital day two .
This CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed .
After a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery , the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant , and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition .
His intracranial pressure remained stable , and his clinical examination was unchanged .
An additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three .
This examination was unchanged from the previous examination .
Again , his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same , and conservative treatment was opted for .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
As described in previous section , Neo-Synephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70 .
A pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four .
This catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support .
Please see Infectious Disease section for more details .
3. GASTROINTESTINAL :
Mr. Roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission .
A orogastric tube was passed .
Initially during admission , carafate was given down the orogastric tube .
However , on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three , a mediastinum was noted .
This raised the question of potential esophageal rupture .
Gastroenterology was consulted for this .
Gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status .
At this point , his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly n.p.o.
4. HEMATOLOGY :
Throughout Mr. Richard admission , his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s .
As will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section , he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis , and his white blood cell count peaked at 23 .
Mr. Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis .
He was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage .
An inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred , as it was felt that Mr. Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure .
5. ENDOCRINE :
Mr. Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale .
6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
Mr. Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers .
His blood urine and sputum were all cultured .
Blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram - positive coagulase - negative Staphylococcus which grew from 08-25 .
His preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew Escherichia coli .
Sputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods , not yet speciated , and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1+ gram-negative rods and 4+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes .
Throughout this time , Mr. Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four , his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade .
During his hospitalization , his was treated with vancomycin for his gram-negative rods , imipenem , and Flagyl .
Initially , he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain , but his cultures became positive , and his white blood cell count increased .
He was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl .
Vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture .
With a fever of 102 , up to 42 degrees centigrade , aggressive measures including cooling blankets , alcohol swabs , and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down .
Hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion , paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering .
7. PULMONARY :
As discussed in the Infectious Disease section , Mr. Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms , but most likely from Escherichia coli .
For this pneumonia , he was placed empirically on imipenem , vancomycin , and Flagyl .
On hospital day three , Mr. Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea .
For this , a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism .
On hospital day four , a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax .
For this , a left #34 Caucasian chest tube was placed .
On the evening of hospital day four , Mr. Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole .
Urgent resuscitation measures were initiated .
The measures included attempts at pacing .
Epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium .
He had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax , cardiac tamponade , and pulmonary embolism .
During the resuscitation afterwards , it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest , so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest .
There was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression , and a right chest tube was placed .
During this time , a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back .
A left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present .
After 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage , there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors .
Resuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27 .
After the termination of resuscitation , both the anesthesia Intensive Care Unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient 's family members including his next of kin , his mother .
Permission for a postmortem examination was granted .

Mr. **NAME[BBB AAA] is a very nice **AGE[in 80s]- year - old white male , right handed , who was admitted to this hospital , **INSTITUTION , transferred from **PLACE with increased wheezing and shortness of breath .
He was found to have lung cancer on CT scan of the chest with a large lung nodule on the left lung as well as a small lung nodule on the right side .
He was taken to the OR on **DATE[Sep 18 2007] , by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] for bronchoscopy , bronchoalveolar lavage , as well as a placement of a right chest tube .
Cytology came back positive for nonsmall cell lung cancer .
The patient was sent to the ICU for couple of days , and he was able to retransfer to the floor .
Today on examination , the patient is awake , alert , and oriented x 3 .
Pupils are equal , round , and reactive to light .
There is no evidence of any neurological deficits .
His temperature is 35.6 , his heart rate is 60 , respiratory rate 20 .
He is saturating at 96% on room air .
His blood pressure is 120/60 mmHg .
His last laboratory workup from yesterday afternoon reveals a sodium of 135 , potassium of 5 with a chloride of 98 , bicarbonate of 23 , creatinine of 2.8 , and BUN of 100 .
He is known to have kidney failure .
White blood cell count from **DATE[Sep 22 2007] , is down to 8000 with a hemoglobin of 11.7 and a hematocrit of 34.9 , and platelet count of 57,000 .
On physical examination , the patient is ventilating adequately on both sides of the thorax with clear entry sounds , perhaps mild wheezing bilaterally .
Cardiac area is rhythmic .
Abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended with good peripheral pulses .
The patient is tolerating the diet and the current problem with him is that while attempting to walk and go to the bathroom , he is complaining about dizziness as well as weakness .
I do not feel that the patient is a candidate for rehabilitation since he has not had any acute problems with walking , trauma , major stroke , or any fractures on the lower extremities .
He does have an old fracture about a month ago or so on the right elbow .
This does not preclude the patient from walking .
His family is not able to take care of him right now , so I would recommend short stay in a skilled nursing facility to continue with his current medication regimen as well as insulin and glucose control .
Once the patient recovers a little bit more of strength , he should be able to return back to home .
On today 's x-ray , I do not see any sign of pleural effusion or pneumothorax .
He should continue on his current medications which include
1. Regular insulin with a low - dose sliding scale before meals .
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Combivent 1 or 2 puffs q.2 h. p.r.n.
4. Pepcid 20 mg by mouth twice a day .
5. Tylenol 650 mg by mouth q.8 h. p.r.n.
6. Vicodin 1 tablet p.o. q.6-8 h. p.r.n.
7. Heparin subcutaneous 5000 units twice a day for DVT prophylaxis .
8. Prednisone wean down , he is currently on 15 mg by mouth daily which should be given as 10 mg p.o. in the morning and 5 mg p.o. in the afternoon .
He should be able to be weaned off the prednisone within a couple of days .
Please , decrease by 5 mg every 3 to 4 days .
9. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily .
Please note that the patient should be seen for followup by Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] in 2 weeks from today and please schedule an appointment with hematology / oncology in his local town , **PLACE .

CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 71 - year-old gentleman who was admitted to the St. Anne 's Hospital as a transfer from the Kindred Park View Specialty Hospital of Springfield .
Prior to admission , he had a long and complicated hospital course at the outside hospital .
His hospital course began on 2014-02-13 when he underwent a right carotid endarterectomy for 95% stenosis of the carotid artery .
His postoperative course was complicated by nonspecific T wave changes consistent with myocardial infarction postoperatively as well as hematoma formation .
The hematoma formation was rapidly expanding and he received an emergent surgical airway in the Intensive Care Unit .
This emergent cricothyroidotomy was converted then to a formal tracheostomy .
During his subsequent hospital course , he had an additional CHF exacerbation .
He was medically managed and eventually his tracheostomy was decannulated .
However , just prior to admission to Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary he had another acute decompensation with CHF exacerbation .
This necessitated emergent intubation .
With EKG changes consistent with myocardial infarction , he was transferred to the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Diabetes type 2 treated with oral medication .
2. Cerebrovascular disease , status post left carotid endarterectomy in 2008 .
3. Status post right cerebrovascular accident in 2009 with residual left-sided weakness .
4. Status post right carotid endarterectomy on 2014-02-13 .
5. Fall from standing on 2014-01-29 with resultant displaced radial fracture which was reduced , closed , and casted .
6. Hypertension .
7. Coronary artery disease .
No history of catheterization prior to admission to the Saint Vincent Hospital .
8. Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 to 2.7.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER THE Stillman Infirmary :
1. Lovenox 1 mg per kilogram subcutaneously b.i.d.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Regular insulin sliding scale .
6. Captopril 6.25 mg q.i.d.
7. Lasix drip at 2 per hour .
8. Versed drip .
9. TPN .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
This is a gentleman who is intubated , comfortable , with minimal sedation .
He was afebrile with a temperature of 99.1 .
His pulse was in the 70s , blood pressure 119/58 .
He was breathing 12 per minute and saturating 98% .
His CVP is ranging from 07-27 .
He was intubated and has a nasogastric tube .
His neck has a well-healed right carotid endarterectomy scar .
There is also a well-healing tracheostomy scar .
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart was regular with an S1 and S2 .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds .
The extremities were without edema .
The left arm was in a cast .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Knueppel was admitted to the CCU at the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary .
Upon admission , he was treated for his pneumonia .
He was medically managed for CHF and underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2014-03-06 .
His catheterization revealed 70% stenosis of the distal left main coronary artery , 90% stenosis of the LAD , 80% stenosis of the circumflex , 90% stenosis of OM2 and a proximally occluded right coronary artery .
After reviewing cardiac catheterization data , a consultation was made with Cardiothoracic Surgery who deemed that he was a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting .
Over the ensuing days , Mr. Nina CHF was managed by the CCU Team and he received treatment for what was now determined to be a Klebsiella pneumonia .
He was treated with a full course of Zosyn .
On 2014-03-11 , Mr. Knueppel went to the Operating Room with Dr. Streeter .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft of four vessels .
He had a saphenous vein graft to his LAD and diagonal in a sequential fashion , saphenous vein graft to his PDA and a saphenous vein graft to his OM .
The procedure was performed by Dr. Streeter and assisted by Dr . .....................
The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication and was transferred to the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit without complication .
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details .
Mr. Knueppel had a long postoperative course .
His postoperative course was complicated by hypertension which was managed medically .
During his postoperative course , he did not suffer from any arrhythmias nor did he have any episode of hypotension .
At the time of discharge , he was on a stable antihypertensive regimen appropriate for someone with a decreased ejection fraction .
Mr. Knueppel had had a long protracted period of intubation prior to the operation .
The status of Mr. Nina pulmonary system necessitated a prolonged postoperative intubation .
After a very slow wean from ventilatory support , Mr. Knueppel was successfully extubated on postoperative day number nine .
He continued to be very tenuous from a pulmonary point of view and required frequent chest PT .
For this reason , Mr. Knueppel was kept in the Intensive Care Unit where very close monitoring could be performed .
In addition , he had chest PT performed at very regular intervals by the ICU staff .
His pulmonary status was so tenuous that we were unable to transfer him to the regular patient care floor during his hospitalization .
Mr. Knueppel had an emergent cricothyroidotomy followed by a formal tracheostomy at the outside hospital .
There is much scarring surrounding his larynx .
Such a situation frequently makes it very difficult to swallow without aspirating .
As is expected , Mr. Knueppel failed a swallowing study early on in his Boston Regional Medical Centerr hospital course .
The study was repeated and yet again Mr. Knueppel was unable to swallow without evidence of aspiration .
After a prolonged period of being fed via nasogastric tube , Mr. Knueppel finally had a formal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed in the Intensive Care Unit .
This was performed on 2014-04-01 , postoperative day number 21 .
This procedure was performed by Dr. Kevin Taussig and assisted by Dr. Carla Solan .
The procedure was performed under endoscopic guidance in the Intensive Care Unit without complication .
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details .
Mr. Knueppel Robertson a distal radius fracture prior to arriving to the hospital .
This injury had been reduced and casted at the outside institution .
Postoperatively , there was much edema associated in the postoperative course from coronary artery bypass grafting .
His cast was removed by the Orthopedic Service in anticipation of this edema and to avoid compartment syndrome .
The cast was replaced by a plaster splint .
Mr. Knueppel should follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon in the Worcester State Hospital for reassessment of his injury and possible removal of the splint .
By postoperative day number 23 , Mr. Nina pulmonary status was deemed sufficiently stable .
His hypertension was well controlled and he was tolerating tube feeds .
At this point , he was ready to be discharged to rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft , four vessels .
2. Congestive heart failure .
3. Klebsiella pneumonia .
4. Failed swallow study status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement .
5. Central line culture positive for coagulase - negative Staphylococcus aureus , status post a 14 day treatment with vancomycin and removal of the line .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Methylphenidate 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Miconazole powder 2% , apply q.i.d. p.r.n.
6. Paxil 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Albuterol nebulizer solution one nebulizer q. four hours .
8. Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
9. Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously q. 12 hours .
10. Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11. Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. four hours p.r.n. pain .
12. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
13. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
14. Tube feedings ; Mr. Knueppel is to be discharged on tube feeds , Promote , with fiber full-strength at 80 cc per hour around the clock .
His PEG tube should be flushed with 30 cc of water after every use .
ACTIVITY :
Mr. Nina activity is ad lib .
He is also to be strict n.p.o.
He should be n.p.o. until he has a repeat swallow evaluation which demonstrates his ability to swallow without aspiration .
FOLLOW-UP :
The patient will follow-up with Dr. Streeter in his office in four to six weeks .
The patient should follow-up with his primary care physician within one week .
The patient should follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon at the next convenient time to determine the length of duration of his casting .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE :
Mr. Knueppel is afebrile with a temperature of 97.1 , pulse 77 , sinus rhythm .
His blood pressure was 142/68 , breathing 21 breaths per minute , 94% on 2 liters nasal cannula .
His pupils were equal , round , and reactive .
Extraocular muscles intact .
His head was normocephalic , atraumatic .
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
He had a PEG tube in his left upper quadrant .
The site was clean and dry .
There was no evidence of necrosis , erythema or exudate at the site .
The extremities were warm and well perfuse .
There was trace edema in both lower extremities .
His right lower extremity has ecchymosis related to a saphenectomy site .
This ecchymosis is much improved from previous examinations .
There was no increased warmth over this area nor is there any exudate from his wounds .
All of his wounds including sternotomy wound were clean , dry , and intact .

Chief Complaint : abdominal pain / nausea
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Intubation
IR guided nephrostomy placement
History of Present Illness :
The patient is a 78 y/o WF w/a PMH significant for HTN and afib who presented to an OSH w/ complaints of abd pain and nausea .
She was found to have a R ureteral stone w/ resultant hydronephrosis and was transferred to Nantucket Cottage Hospital for ureteral stent placement .
Her INR was found to be elevated when admitted and , in the course of waiting for this to normalize , the patient spiked a temperature to 105 and became hypotensive to the 70s .
She was bolused w/out effect and had little response to neo so she was changed to levophed , given doses of cipro / vanco / gent and transferred to the CMED CSRU for management .
In the CMED , urology was consulted and the patient received a R nephrostomy tube .
However , tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture , afib , and increased dyspnea .
She was intubated for this hypoxia and treated with lasix , metoprolol , and diltiazem .
She was weaned off her pressors on 02-21 and maintained her pressure w/out additional fluid boluses .
Her sedation was weaned down and she was successfully extubated shortly thereafter .
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for > 24 hr on this regimen .
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem and has been in NSR since this time .
She was restarted on heparin prior to d/c as a bridge to therapeutic coumadin anticoagulation .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
78 year old female with history of HTN , a.fib presenting with ureteral stone , hydronephrosis , and urosepsis .
She originally had hypotension and a leukocytosis in the ER and was admitted to the CMED CCU .
In the CMED , urology was consulted and the patient received a R nephrostomy tube .
However , tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture , afib , and increased dyspnea .
She was intubated for this hypoxia and treated with lasix , metoprolol , and diltiazem .
She was weaned off her pressors on 02-21 and maintained her pressure w/out additional fluid boluses .
Her sedation was weaned down and she was successfully extubated shortly thereafter .
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for > 24hr on this regimen .
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem on the day of call-out .
1. Sepsis - The patient was septic in the ER and her blood cultures eventually grew proteus .
Her Bcx remained negative throughout her stay .
She was treated with levaquin on the floor and will complete a 14d course at rehab .
She has been afebrile since she was called out to the floor .
2. Ureteral stone - The patient had a nephrostomy tube placed by IR to relieve her hydronephrosis .
She was followed by urology during her stay and will see them again 2 wk after d/c for definitive treatment of her nephrolithiasis .
At this time , urology will coordinate removal of her nephrostomy tube with IR .
Her nephrostomy tube was draining clear yellow urine at the time of d/c .
3. a.fib - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation controlled with beta blockers at home .
She was treated in the CMED as above .
Once on the floor , the patient had one episode of afib w/ RVR that responded immediately to IV metoprolol .
Because of this , the patient 's diltiazem was stopped and she was started on tid metoprolol .
After this , the patient had no further problems with her rate control .
She was maintained on a heparin gtt for bridge to coumadin while on the floor after this was cleared by IR and urology .
She will be d/c w/out her heparin as she is trending upwards with her INR and has no MR Paul Paquettec heart disease .
She will continue her coumadin at rehab to achieve an INR between 03-22 .
4. delirium - The patient had troubles with agitation while in the CMED CCU .
She received prn haldol w/ little effect and improved as her infection cleared .

The patient is **AGE[in 80s] years of age .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an unfortunate individual who has advanced terminal bladder carcinoma with local invasion causing severe obstructive uropathy to both kidneys requiring nephrostomies during his previous admission .
Unfortunately , even given the nephrostomies , the patient 's condition has continued to deteriorate with progressive renal failure and bleeding from the urinary bladder .
He was seen during his course of admissions by his surgeon and his urologist as well as Nephrology ; all felt that there is nothing else that can be done except comfort measures .
Discussions were held with Mr. **NAME[AAA] .
He continues to refuse dialysis which would be his only intervention that would help him survive his progressive renal failure .
Certainly , it would not change the terminal nature of his bladder cancer .
With this in mind , he opted strictly for comfort measures , and we are now referring him to a hospice center .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Dec 24 07]
I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male status post laparotomy and debridement in the setting of pancreatitis .
This patient 's hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure and ARDS .
I am seeing him for management of this and multiple medical problems .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the surgical team and critical care house staff .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure - The patient has unchanged bilateral infiltrates on the chest x-ray from today and we were able to maintain him on BiPAP at settings of 15/8 over last night and he maintained an oxygen saturation at about 90% .
Unfortunately , he was not able to tolerate time off BiPAP yesterday and today we will try to keep him off the BiPAP and try to go on more scheduled on and off BiPAP cycles .
For his respiratory failure , I am also diuresing this patient and continuing him on Lasix drip .
My plan for the next 24 hours is to keep him negative a liter net fluid balance .
We will watch his BUN and creatinine for his renal function .
His BUN today is 16 and creatinine is 0.7 .
2. Hypertension - The patient is on Captopril , Lopressor and I also added clonidine for the management of his hypertension .
We are making gradual headway in terms of treatment of his hypertension .
Part of the reason for his hypertension also may be agitation because of ventilator weaning trials .
3. ICU prophylaxis - The patient is on heparin drip for prophylaxis after his SMA repair and he also is on peptic ulcer prophylaxis .
Total critical care time spent was 36 minutes .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 48 - year-old woman who was transferred from Shaugnessy-Kaplan Rehab Hospital .
The patient originally presented to her PCP approximately one week prior to admission here with increasing cough , dyspnea and fatigue .
She was given a Z-Pak for treatment along with albuterol .
Despite this , she continued to worsen and became febrile .
So , she was admitted to Shaugnessy-Kaplan Rehab Hospital on 2015-07-10 .
At the hospital , she was started on Rocephin and Levaquin for a right lower lobe pneumonia seen on chest x-ray .
She continued to have increasing respiratory distress with hypoxia .
She was also significantly tachypneic .
At this time , repeat chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates consistent with ARDS .
The patient was intubated and then transferred to Hahnemann General Hospital CMED .

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES :
Chest x-ray shows right middle lobe , right lower lobe , and left lower lobe infiltrates .
EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with normal axis and intervals , borderline LVH .
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Respiratory :
On admission , the patient had what appeared to be acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to community - acquired pneumonia .
She was maintained on a ventilator and ventilated according to ARDSNet protocol .
For antibiotic coverage of her pneumonia , she was started on Levaquin , ceftriaxone , and vancomycin .
Over the next two days after admission , the patient 's vent settings were gradually weaned , and she was extubated two days after being transferred to this hospital .
After extubation , the patient was oxygenating well on face mask .
She did continue to have a persistent fairly severe cough ; however , her cough was weak due to abdominal muscle pain from repeated coughing .
The cough was mostly nonproductive .
The patient was breathing comfortably .
As there was no identified bacterial pathogen on any cultures , the patient was continued on the triple antibiotics for first several days of the hospitalization .
She was also on round-the-clock Atrovent and albuterol nebulizers .
Once the patient was transferred out of the ICU and after extubation , the antibiotics were gradually narrowed .
The vancomycin and Levaquin were discontinued after approximately four days in the hospital .
The ceftriaxone was discontinued after four days in the hospital , and the patient was to continue on Levaquin .
The patient had gradual improvement in her oxygenation .
Pain control :
The patient had fairly significant abdominal pain secondary to persistent cough .
She was started on a regimen of MS Contin with oxycodone for breakthrough pain .
This helped her somewhat though she has continued to have difficulty coughing due to the pain .
Tylenol and ibuprofen were also added for better control .
Transaminitis :
The patient was noted to have mild transaminitis on admission .
However , this was felt to be due to her significant infection .
This should continue to be followed as an outpatient to assure that it returns back to normal .
Anemia :
The patient 's reticulocyte count showed inadequate production .
Iron studies showed a mixed picture with decreased iron and decreased iron to TIBC ratio suggestive of iron-deficiency anemia , but also normal to high MCV .
B12 was noted to be low and the patient was given an injection of IM B12 while in the hospital .
She was also started on iron supplementation .
Hypothyroidism :
The patient was continued on Synthroid for her chronic hypothyroidism .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
The patient was discharged home with services .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
Community-acquired pneumonia .
Acute respiratory distress syndrome .
Iron-deficiency anemia .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Breunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .
She is referred for progressive angina .
She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .
She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .
In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .
In October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .
She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .
In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .
She had exertional angina at that time .
In November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .
She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .
Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .
She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
Because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .
In May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .
She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .
She has had no syncope .
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .
She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .
She is a remote cigarette smoker .
She also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .
She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci
She lives alone .
Her son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .
They live in Ohio .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .
Her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .
Neck veins are not distended .
Respiratory rate 12 .
Carotids :
no bruits .
Lungs were clear .
Cardiac :
1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological examination non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .
Hematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .
Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .
She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .
Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .
The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .
The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .
The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .
This was considered her culprit lesion .
This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .
In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .
Her left internal mammary artery was also unused .
It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .
She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .
This was intermittent .
The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .
The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .
It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .
Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .
She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .
When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .
Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .
He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .
For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .
On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .
There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .
It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .
She tolerated this well .
Her medications were resumed .
She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .

Brief Hospital Course :
BRIEF OVERVIEW :
57 yo F with h/o polyglandular autoimmune syndrome initially admitted in May to FICU for suicide overdose then transferred to Whittier Rehab Hospital 4 for depression , who was transferred to the medical floor for a syncopal episode and hypotension to 60 systolic that returned to baseline with 2.5L IVF who was subsequently transferred to the CMED CSRU for a recurrent episode of hypotension , fevers and concern for sepsis .
Initially when she arrived to the floor she was afebrile , normotensive without signs of orthostasis , had a negative UA , a clear chest xray and no signs / symptoms of a fever .
She was slightly tachycardic .
She was initially not started on antibiotics .
She was given a standing IVF order .
Overnight she became febrile to 102.3 , increasingly tachycardic to 125 , and hypotensive to 80 systolic .
She was started on stress dose steroids and levo , flagyl , and vanco .
She was given 4L of fluid boluses and transfered to the CMED CSRU .
In the CMED CSRU , repeated attempts to place lines were unsuccessful .
The above treatments were continued .
Urine cultures returned with 10-100,000 organisms coag negative staph .
Blood cultures remained negative .
Vital signs stabilized and she was transfered back to the medical floor after 2 days in the ICU .
Stress dose steroids were planned for a 7 day course , antibiotics were peeled back to levofloxacin alone , and a R hip film revealed no loosening nor inflammation .
Echo showed normal function , trace AR , and no MR .
She had a normal RUQ US , as well .
On the floor the patient remained stable hemodynamically without recurrent fever and was stable for transfer back to Franciscan Children 's Hospital & Rehab Center 4 .
At the time of discharge , her potassium had been low despite repletion , Na was elevated , as was blood pressure .
On recommendation from endocrine , her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 ( higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms . ) .
1. Hypotension :
Patient presented after episode of hypotension and syncope on Mass. Mental Health Center 5 .
Initially it was felt that this was a result of poor PO intake .
She was afebrile without orthostatic vital signs nor hypotension .
She had no symptoms of infectious source , normal UA , normal chest xray , and no symptoms nor signs of injury after her fall with syncope .
Neuro exam was normal .
Subsequently overnight , she developed a fever to 102.3 and recurrent hypotension in the setting of fevers and tachycardia that was concerning for an infectious source .
She still had no localizing signs of infection and culture data was negative to be negative .
RUQ US was ordered and returned without signs of infection later .
She was started on stress dose steroids .
She had cultures drawn , was given tylenol ( tylenol screen prior to this dose was negative , as was a urine tox ) , was started on levofloxacin , metronidazole , and vancomycin to cover emperically for hospital aquired pneumonia , GI sources , and a potential hip infection .
Her transaminases were slightly elevated , which was later attributed to shock liver as a result of her period of hypotension .
Lipase and amylase remained normal .
In the ICU she also received an echo that revealed normal function and little valvular disease ( she has two loud systolic murmurs on exam ) , and a hip film revealing no inflammation nor loosening .
Urine culture twice grew 10-100,000 coag negative staph .
A line could not be placed for technical reasons , however after 4L NS on the floor and 01-30 more in the ICU via peripheral IV 's she was stable .
She remained hemodynamically stable with good UOP in the setting of being started on abx and stress dose steroids .
The steroids were thought to have helped significantly in in the setting of Addison 's with possibely superimposed infection .
The patient was planned for a 7 day course of stress dose steroids followed by a return to her basal predinisone / fludrocortisone dose .
2. Elevated LFTs :
LFTs wre elevated at presentation .
Initially the differential was thought to include shock liver from hypotension , hepatitis , cholangitis or choledocholithiasis .
Hepatitis serologies were negative and the pt was eventually felt to have had shock liver from her hypotensive episode as the transaminitis resolved over time .
3. Hypoparathyroidism :
This is a chronic problem .
calcium levels were followed with a goal to keep them around 8.0 by continuing Calcium carbonate , calcitriol .
The pt required calcium gluconate x1 the day prior to discharge .
Per endocrine at the time of discharge , the pt may need an increase in calcium PO , but at this time they recommended no change .
It will need to be monitored over time .
4. Addison 's- The patient is on basal prednisone / fludrocortisone .
These were initially continued as above and later , when she became hypotensive and febrile , stress dose steroids were started and planned for a 7 day course followed by a return to her prior dose of prednisone .
At the time of discharge , her potassium had been low despite repletion ,
Na was elevated , as was blood pressure .
On recommendation from endocrine , her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 ( higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms. ) .
5. DM :
Light followed the patient .
She was continued on her prior dose of steroids with sliding scale per patient using a 1:15 carb counting scheme with a 1:30 correction factor .
On the day of discharge her glargine was decreased by one unit because her glucose remained somewhat low in the mornings .
6. R Hip pain :
Later in her hospital course , the pt complained of hip pain .
A R hip film was negative for pathology or failure of her hip replacement .
Pain was controlled with tylenol and the pt was reassured .
PT was consulted .
The pt uses a wheelchair often at baseline due to pain from arthritis .
7. Depression :
The pt was being treated at Mediplex Rehab Hospital 4 for suicidal ideation and a suicide attempt on original admission with tylenol and oxycodone .
She had planned this attempt carefully without the knowledge of those close to her and very much expected her attempt to work .
She had been depressed for some time but her loved ones were very surprised at her attempt .
She remained very depressed at her inpatient admission and refractory to treatment .
One day prior to her transfer to the medical floor she was sectioned to initiate ECT , which she had previously refused .
As a result , she was maintained on her ativan , mirtazapine , risperidone , duloxetine .
She did not exhibit psychotic symptoms .
She had a 1:1 sitter at all times .
She denied any suicidality but did endorse depression .
She denied HI , SI , and illusions / hallucinations .
Her mood appeared stable throughout her hospitalization .
She was followed by psychiatry in consultation while she was on the medical floor .
The patient did have heparin subcutaneously while on the medical floor and in the ICU .
She remained full code throughout the hospitalization .
As on prior hospitalization , her HCP was shared by Dianne White .

DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
12/05/93
DISCHARGE DATE :
12/17/93
CAUSE OF DEATH :
Cardiogenic shock .
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .
His pulse exam was intact .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .
Total crossclamp time :
1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient &apos;s increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient &apos;s prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient &apos;s rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

OTHER WORKUP :
A CT scan of the abdomen on **DATE[Feb 30 2007] , showed impression :
No evidence of a bowel obstruction or ileus .
Multiple cholelithiasis , prostate enlargement , moderately large right inguinal hernia containing nonobstructed bowel loops , and bilateral small multiple diaphragmatic intrathoracic pleural calcifications .
A chest x-ray on **DATE[Mar 1 2007] , showed a normal chest .
??? A CT of the abdomen on **DATE[Mar 4 2007] ; impression :
Bilateral small pleural effusions , minimal ascites , cholelithiasis , moderately enlarged soft - tissue density in the left retroperitoneal region suggestive of hematoma , enlarged prostate , and right inguinal hernia .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old gentleman who was admitted to the **INSTITUTION through the emergency room when he was brought there complaining of generalized weakness , excessive swelling of the lower extremities , and some abdominal discomfort of minimal degree .
The patient has a history of bipolar disorder , depression , prostatic hypertrophy , and chronic anemia .
He was evaluated and was placed on diuretics ; subsequently , the venous Doppler studies did confirm DVT affecting the left lower extremity .
The patient was placed on subcutaneous Lovenox .
He also was treated with elevation of the feet .
On **DATE[Mar 4 2007] , he became confused , disoriented , hypotensive , and was transferred to CVU .
His hemoglobin did drop significantly also and a transfusion was undertaken .
A subsequent CT scan did confirm retroperitoneal hematoma .
He was evaluated by vascular surgery service , Dr. **NAME[XXX] , and pulmonary service was also consulted .
The surgical service , Dr. **NAME[WWW] , was consulted .
The patient was monitored closely in the intensive care unit , where hemoglobin and hematocrit were closely monitored and transfusions were given to maintain hemoglobin around 10 grams .
He had abdominal pain relieved with morphine .
He had no reversible obstructive bowel process ; however , he gradually did improve although he was noted to have a left pleural effusion which was tapped and was noted to be hemorrhagic .
A thoracic surgical consultation was asked from Dr. **NAME[VVV] and he thought that no surgical intervention was necessary at this point .
The patient was also not very keen to undergo any such surgical intervention .
His respiratory status remained fairly stable and he did gradually improve .
His abdominal pain subsided .
He was able to tolerate some liquids .
His hemoglobin and hematocrit also remained stable .
He was transferred to TCU for continued monitoring and care in stable condition .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Jul 26 07]
I am currently seeing this **AGE[in 80s]- year - old gentleman on 8D , where a Condition was called secondary to seizures .
The patient has a past medical history significant for normal-pressure hydrocephalus , dementia and coronary artery disease status post CABG in the past .
Upon initial evaluation , after responding to the code on 8D , the patient was having seizure activity .
I did obtain IV access peripherally .
I gave the patient 2 mg of Ativan .
The seizure broke , but then again he had another seizure for which he did get another 2 mg of Ativan .
He continued to seize , and at that point I thought it was probably reasonable to go ahead and get his airway protected .
He again seized and got propofol for this and subsequently the patient did vomit and clearly aspirated .
Intubation was performed and of note the patient did aspirate .
He was bagged with 10 of PEEP and sats did come up to 100% .
Hemodynamically , initially he was a little bit hypotensive .
____________ and the blood pressure did respond to this .
In light of his seizures , I did transport the patient down to CT Scan , for a CT scan of his head , and then transferred the patient to the NICU for further management .
Assessment :
Seizure activity , rule out increased ICP and hydrocephalus .
The patient is going for a CT scan of his head .
He has aspiration pneumonia as well .
Critical care time = 35 minutes .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Le is a seventy three year old male who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , following a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head .
Mr. Le was found in bed with a 32 caliber revolver at his side .
The patient was apparently alone at home , his neighbors heard a single shot , and the paramedics were called .
Upon arrival , they found the patient in bed , with notes nearby , listing his funeral home preferences and information on his next of kin .
The patient indicates that his neighbors were making excessive noise upstairs from his dwelling , and he found it unbearable .
He therefore decided to take his life with a gun which he had found in the house .
Apparently , the gun belonged to his father .
On further questioning , the patient described that his father passed away approximately forty to fifty years prior to his admission , and the gun was found in a box in their home .
The patient expressed concern that he had several utility bills that he was unable to pay .
The patient &apos;s sister died eight years prior to the patient &apos;s admission of leukemia , and he otherwise has no next of kin with the exception of one brother in Washington , with whom his relationship is tenuous .
On initial questioning , however , the patient denies any recent losses .
On admission , the patient denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. hypertension ,
2. poor dentition .

The patient has never been married and has no children .
He has a sixty to seventy five pack year smoking history and drinks alcohol approximately one time per week .
He denies any ilicit drug use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is an obese male in no acute distress .
The vital signs temperature 98.0 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 186/69 , respirations 18 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination revealed an entry wound approximately 1 1/2 inches above the right ear , which is approximately 1 cm. in length and surrounded by powder burn .
There is a lump in the right parietal region , which corresponds with the bullet seen on the computerized tomography scan .
There is no bruising about the eyes or mastoid sinuses , and there is no fluid from the nose or ears .
The neck was supple , and without adenopathy .
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm and no murmur , rub or gallop are appreciated .
The abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended , without hepatosplenomegaly .
There are no masses and the bowel sounds are present .
The extremities are well perfused and there is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Neurological :
examination revealed a patient who was alert and oriented X 3 , with short term recall of 2/3 objects at five minutes and fluent speech .
The patient remembers the presidents as Carter-Bush-Regan-Truman-Roosevelt .
The patient was able to spell world backwards on the third attempt .
He performed serial 7 &apos;s accurately .
He demonstrated poor ability for abstract thinking .
Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact .
The pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , and the extra ocular movements are intact .
The fundi are benign and the discs are sharp .
The patient &apos;s strength is 5/5 throughout and the sensorium is intact .
The deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical throughout .
LABORATORY DATA :
A panel of serum electrolytes is normal .
The white blood count is 9.4 , hematocrit 47.1 , and the platelets 253,000 .
Blood coagulation times are normal .
Serum toxic screen is negative .
Leukocyte differential count reveals 64 neutrophils , 24% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , 2% eosinophils , and 2% basophils .
A panel of serum enzymes suggest normal hepatic function .
A computerized tomography scan of the head reveals a small external skull fracture , approximately 1-2 millemeters in size , near the right frontoparietal apex .
A right parietal contusion is also identified , with blood tracking into the middle focus .
Standard 12 lead electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 85 , with poor R wave progression in leads V1 through V3 suggesting the possibility of an old anteroseptal myocardial infarction .
Nonspecific ST segment and T wave abnormalities are present as well .
Otherwise , the axis is normal and the intervals are normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca , M.D.
Prior to his admission , the patient &apos;s gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room .
The patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge .
The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter .
Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended .
From a medical standpoint , the patient did well .
He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization .
The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine .
After his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward .
Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen .
The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient , and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note .
By the 7th hospital day , the patient was medically stable .
He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation , and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital .
Therefore , because of his need for intense psychiatric care , the patient is discharged to the Vo Black Doylestrictshore Ft. Clinics Medical Center on the 7th hospital day .

Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a very pleasant **AGE[in 40s]- year - old African American lady who works at **INSTITUTION , she apparently did not go to again .
The night that she came to the ER , she was having chest pain on and off all day .
When she came to the emergency room , she was found to have significant ST elevation inferiorly and anterolaterally .
I was called to see her around 2 o 'clock and I came in to see her .
I was concerned about an acute coronary syndrome .
Her first troponins were negative .
We took her to the catheterization laboratory where she had a totally occluded diagonal .
I was preparing to do an angioplasty .
In the usual fashion , I was placing a guide catheter in the left main coronary artery .
I injected some nitroglycerin and took another picture , and the diagonal dramatically opened up .
The tombstone ST elevation in the inferolateral and anterolateral leads dramatically came down , and this patient 's chest pain dramatically subsided .
I watched **NAME[BBB] in the catheterization laboratory for about 15 to 20 minutes , and I kept looking at this artery , and it stayed opened .
At that point , I did not see any plaque or any lesion that required dilatation or angioplasty , so I ended the procedure .
I did a ventriculogram that showed segmental wall motion abnormality at the distal diaphragmatic wall with an EF of about 50% .
End - diastolic pressure was high , but a suspected risk due to the acute spasm would come down .
I placed this patient on the floor .
She did have a very mild pain in her right groin .
Clinically , she did not have a hematoma ; although , she complained of some pain there .
We have given her some narcotics for that time , but it is now better , and she is going to go home this morning .
She understands that she cannot smoke .
She needs to diet , exercise , and lose weight .
I explained to her that she had intense coronary spasm .
I did do a tox screen to rule out cocaine abuse , and there was no cocaine on board .
There were some narcotics on board , but we had given her morphine in the emergency room ; so , I am not surprised about that .
I am not exactly sure what the etiology of his coronary spasm is , but it is clearly coronary spasm when you look at the films , one of the most dramatic cases I have seen in my 20 years of practice .
This patient has a CPK of over 3000 , but her vessel was now open .
She has not developed any Q waves on her electrocardiogram , although she does have nonspecific ST-T abnormalities .
She is going to go home on a combination of Cardizem and nitrates .
I have given her beta blocker because of tachycardia and hypertension as well .
She is going to remain on her Depakote and remain on her Effexor .
I did order a lipid profile that is pending at this time .
I will probably want to treat her with cholesterol - lowering medicines , but I will make that decision on an outpatient basis .
This patient understands that she needs to take a week off .
She will see me in the office .
I will get an echocardiogram and a stress test ; and hopefully , clear her for going back to work in a week or two .
Finally , this patient complained on the day of discharge about burning on urination .
We did not put a Foley into her during her catheterization or during her hospital stay .
However , I did send off the urine and C and S , and I did empirically place her on Bactrim .
I will follow that up in my office as well .
This patient understands that should she have any chest pain , shortness of breath , or other medical problems , she should call immediately .
CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE :
Stable .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Jadiara Harrison is twin #1 born to a 17 year-old primiparous mother at 31 weeks gestation .
Mother was admitted to the Nantucket Cottage Hospital from Lawrence General Hospital Hospital on 05-01 with cervical effacement and preterm labor .
She was treated with magnesium sulfate .
She had previously been admitted here at the 24th week after a motor vehicle accident. She was treated with tocolysis and betamethasone at that time .
Due to progressing labor and presentation of twins , delivery was by Cesarean section .
Prenatal screens were notable for blood type 0 positive , antibody negative , hepatitis B surface antigen negative , RPR nonreactive .
Rubella status was not documented .
Group B strep status was unknown .
Infant emerged from the breech position .
She was vigorous .
She was given blow-by oxygen and stimulation .
Her Apgars were 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes .
She was brought to the CMED CSRU for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
ON admission , physical examination reveals a non dysmorphic infant , well saturated and perfused with multiple bruises noted over the upper legs , left arm and chest .
No bony abnormalities or petechiae noted .
She was moving all joints and extremities well .
HEENT :
Within normal limits .
CV :
Normal S1 and S2 without a murmur .
Lungs were clear .
Abdomen was benign .
Genitalia normal .
Premature female .
Neuro :
Non focal and age appropriate .
Hips normal , held in the breech position .
Anus patent .
Spine intact .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Respiratory :
On admission , infant did not require supplemental oxygen or respiratory support .
Since that time , Jadiara has always been in room air without requiring supplemental oxygen .
She was noted to have apnea of prematurity , treated with caffeine until 2017-06-04 .
Since that time , she has had very rare spells , with none for over one week by the time of discharge .
Cardiovascular :
She was hemodynamically stable upon admission with normal blood pressures and heart rate .
On day of life 15 , she was noted to have a murmur , eventually prompting evaluation by ECHO .
The ECHO revealed an anomalous left coronary , with one end entering the right ventricular outflow tract and the other end not clearly defined .
It was unable to be delineated whether this represented an anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery ( LCAPA ) or a left coronary artery fistula to the pulmonar artery .
The right coronary was prominent , and there appeared to be coronary artery collateral vessels in the posterior apical myocardium .
A small apical muscular VSD was also noted .
Several additional ECHOs were performed , including an ECHO in the cardiology department at HealthSouth Rehab Hospital of Western Mass. , but the anatomy of the left coronary artery could not be further defined .
Due to the risks of coronary ischemia if this represented an LCAPA , the infant was followed with regular ECHOs and EKGs during the remainder of hospitalization , with no evidence of ischemia , valvular regurgitation , or compromised ventricular function .
She will be continued to be followed closely by cardiology as an outpatient , with likely plans for cardiac catheterization and surgical repair when she grows to 3.5 to 4 kg .
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The infant was initially maintained on IVF , with introduction of enteral feeds on day of life 2 .
She was advanced to full volume enteral feeds by day of life 7 , and then to a maximum caloric density of 28 cals / oz .
Oral feedings were introduced as tolerated .
By the time of discharge , infant is feedign BM or enfamil 24 cals / oz PO ad lib , with adequate intake and adequate weight gain .
Last nutrition labs were on 06-20 with AP of 208 , Ca 10.8 , and Phos 7.4.
Gastrointestinal :
The infant required phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia through day of life 7 , with peak bilirubin of 7 / 0.3 on day of life 3 , and last bilirubin of 4.9 / 0.3 on day of life 9 .
Hematologic / Infectious disease :
CBC and blood culture were obtained upon admission revealing a white blood cell count of 9.0 with 25 polys and 0 bands ; hematocrit was 46.9% and platelets of 222,000 .
Baby received 48 hours of Ampicillin and Gentamycin with negative cultures and a stable clinical course .
Infant was treated with supplemental iron , and did not receive any blood transfusions .
Last Hct was 30.6 on 06-20 with a reticulocyte count of 6.5%.
Neurologic :
Baby has been appropriate for gestational age .
Social :
Mother is 17 years old , and has been accompanied on the majority of her visits by her parents , both of whom are students .
The infant 's maternal grandparents have been very involved in her care .
Sensory :
Initial opthalmologic exam on 06-05 revealed immature retinas in zone 3 , and repeat exam on 06-26 revealed mature retinas bilaterally .
Infant passed hearing screen prior to discharge .

She had CA-125 which was pending at the time of discharge .
Her hematocrit was 31.1 , WBC 11.6 and 151,000 platelets .
PLAN :
The patient is thus stage IV endometrial and stage III-C ovarian vs metastatic endometrial for line II , cycle I chemotherapy IFEX , MESNA and VP-16 .
The plan was for urinalysis q d .
With the history of DVT , we plan Coumadin and check her coags .
The patient was tachycardiac on admission and it was felt she was dehydrated and / or anxious at the time of her initial evaluation .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia and incomplete right bundle branch block .

She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient 's urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .
A repeat straight cath was negative for RBC 's .
After 1 day of chemotherapy , the patient had 8-10 RBC 's in her urine but by the second day of her IFEX infusion , she had 50-80 RBC 's in her urine as well as a few transitional epithelial cells .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
She did receive her VP-16 without complication .
Other significant issues were the patient 's hematocrit on admission at 31.1 which dwindled down to 26.2 by 9-10  .
The patient was counselled and received 2 units of packed RBC 's at that time  .
However , the patient 's hematocrit bumped only to 28.1 and a repeat later on 9-11 , showed hematocrit of 27.6 .
At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC 's were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 .
Her repeat on 9-8 , was 36.0 / 68.2 and her Coumadin was held .
She received no Coumadin during her admission and by the time of discharge , her PT was down to 16.2 .

Urinalysis demonstrated 30-50 white blood cells with red blood cells too numerous to count and 2+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of prostate CA , for fluid rehydration .
Initially , the patient was begun on Bactrim for presumptive urinary tract infection and the initial course of his hospitalization , he took p.o.' s poorly .
The patient remained afebrile , however , and his electrolytes were within normal limits .
By hospital day number six , however , the patient became febrile to 100.7 and repeat urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells and 1+ bacteria .
Antibiotics were switched to IV Ciprofloxacin and the patient defervesced ; however , by hospital day number seven , the patient was found to be passing very little urine through his condom catheter and electrolyte screen and electrolytes from hospital day number seven showed a BUN of 27 and a creatinine of 2.7 .
The patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated ; however , by hospital day number nine , BUN was 22 , creatinine was 3.5 .
A Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine .
Subsequently , the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day .
Blood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 .
The patient 's fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 .
The patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 .
Gradually over the course of the following days , the patient 's electrolytes again normalized ; however , as the patient continues to take p.o.' s poorly , the patient remained on IV hydration therapy .
On hospital day number fourteen , electrolytes were sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 .
The patient was taking 470 cc of liquid p.o. and is now in stable condition and ready for transfer to El Hospital to continue his recovery .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is transferred to El Hospital , still receiving IV hydration at a rate currently of 50 cc an hour of D5 one-half normal with 20 mEq of K .
Should the patient 's p.o. intake drop to below 500 , the patient should be hydrated at 75 cc/hour .
If the patient 's p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day , the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour .
The Foley catheter was in place and the Bacitracin ointment should be applied to the urethral meatus twice a day .
Periodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection .
It should be noted that while in the hospital , the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer .
The patient is discharged on Mylanta 30 cc with meals , Carafate 1 gm q. 6 , Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until the patient regains full activity and IV hydration .
The Foley should be in place until a follow-up appointment with Dr. Aarhalt can be scheduled in approximately one to two weeks at which time a decision regarding the status of the patient 's urinary obstruction will be addressed .

The patient was placed on telemetry and had no telemetry events while an inpatient .
He was also seen by the Electrophysiology service , his pacemaker was interrogated and working fine , with no signs of recent ventricular arrhythmia .
The patient his undergoing a TTE prior to discharge to rule out a thrombus .
His TTE showed EF 45-50% , moderate cLVH , abnormal diastolic function , moderate MR , moderate TR and severe LAE .
THere was a question of ionfiltrative cardiomyopathy , and the patient underwent abdominal fat pad biopsy to assess for amyloidosis .
He also currently has an SPEP / UPEP/Beta 2 microglobulin / ACE test that are currently pending .
These should be followed up as an outaptient .
He had carotid ultrasound studies 3 months ago that were normal without evidence for stenosis .
2. Renal - cont MWF HD ; electrolytes have been stable .
Perhaps his recent falls are related to orthostatic hypotension after dialysis .

Patient initially presented in 1991 with cervical lymphadenopathy , was treated with MACE / CytaBOM , and did well until 1997 , when he received six cycles of fludarabine for progressive disease .
In November , 2001 , he progressed to leukemic phase , received Rituxan and CVP .
Started Campath in July , 2001 , complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and CMV infection , and underwent MUD stem cell transplant in December , 2002 .
The patient had bone marrow biopsy , August , 2003 , for persistent pancytopenia , revealing mild hypercelluarity with 80% leukemic cells .
He was again treated with Campath , had recurrent fever in association with sinus symptoms , with CT scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks .
Patient was hospitalized September 26 to November 11 for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head CT and MRI ) .
ID consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin , itraconazole , and pentamidine , with progression of skin infection .
Subsequent discontinuance of azithromycin , trial of 5-FC , with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance , change if itraconazole to voriconazole , given continued neutropenia , and trial of sulfadiazine , discontinued for increasing ARS .
Patient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole and IV pentamidine , with pentamidine nasal washings , with re-CT of sinuses near end of stay showing no change in disease burden .
He has had recurrent CMB infection in the setting of Campath therapy , requiring IV Foscarnet therapy during stay , with inability to tolerate valganciclovir maintenance suppression subsequently due to increasing ARS .
Hypercapture near end of stay was negative .
Patient experienced acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency , with previous baseline creatinine 1.6 , felt to be due to medication toxicity , requiring Kayexalate and Phoslo to manage electrolytes , but never any need for hemodialysis , with mild improvement of creatinine by discharge , with peak creatinine 3.4 , discharge creatinine 2.6 .
Patient struggled with GVHD , with extensive skin involvement , taking Cellcept , prednisone and cyclosporine at time of last admission .
Cellcept was discontinued in the setting of infection , but attempts to decrease prednisone or cyclosporine were unsuccessful .
Patient returns from rehabilitation after discharge on November 11 , with new fever up to 102.0 in DSCI clinic , increasing hepatomegaly as assessed by examination in clinic , and increasing creatinine .
Patient reports no significant changes in how he feels over the past week .
Denies cough , shortness of breath , chest pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria , neck stiffness , new skin lesions , worsening red petechiae , or increasing sinus symptoms .
Patient reports persistent mild right upper quadrant discomfort , recent poor appetite .

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 129 , creatinine 3.0 , BUN 70 , potassium 5.0 , bicarbonate 23 , chloride 99 , ALT 36 , AST 30 , alkaline phosphatase 215 , total bilirubin 1.1 , albumin 2.6 , white blood cell count 2.0 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelets 60 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .
Workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report .
Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on November 20 , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
A repeat CMV hypercapture , negative for presence of CMV .
A repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of November 9 , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .
In the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba .
Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .
Pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .
Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on November 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .
Idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .
However , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .
Most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
A single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on November 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .
Patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .
On November 30 , a family meeting with patient &apos;s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. Tomedankell Bile , attending physician , Dr. Mellerny Close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient &apos;s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
Decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient &apos;s comfort .
Pentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient &apos;s comfort .
DNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .
The patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .
Tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .
Such measures have been continued through December 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time .

There is moderate prominence of ventricles and sulci , inappropriate for the patient 's age .
There is no midline shift , mass effect , hydrocephalus , or territorial infarct .
Following gadolinium , no evidence of abnormal parenchymal , vascular , or meningeal enhancement seen .
Gastric biopsy : negative for H. pylori .
Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was re-admitted to the surgical service and taken to the CMED .
A chest x-ray on admission showed effusions consistent with CHF along with overlying pnumonia .
Urine cultures were significant for Klebsiella UTI and sputum cultures were significant for MRSA .
He was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacin and fluconazole .
He underwent PICC line placement on 06-18 .
A trach collar was placed on 06-19 .
GI was consulted for colonoscopy .
Patient was transferred to the floor on 06-20 .
He was seen by respiratory therapy and suctioned continually throughout his hospital course .
His respiratory status improved .
He tolerated his trach collar , and tube feeds at goal .
The fluconazole was discontinued .
On 06-21 the patient was seen by physical therapy .
A nutrition consult was obtained on 06-22 .
He underwent a failed bedside swallow study .
Based on a chest x-ray that showed a small hydro-pneumothorax on the left lower lobe of the lung , a thoracic surgery consult was obtained , though no specific interventions were warranted at the time .
On 06-23 the patient 's tube feed were changed from Respalor to Deliver 2.0 to give increased calories .
On 06-25 , urine cultures grew out VRE , and a C diff was negative .
He experienced low grade fevers .
He was pan-cultured on 06-26 for continued fevers .
On 06-27 , his nutrition regimen was changed to Deliver 2.0 at 70 cc / hr with 15 g ProMod .
On 06-28 , the patient experienced PVC 's .
An EKG showed ST segment depression along the lateral pre-cordial leads .
Serial enzymes showed mild elevation of troponins .
A cardiology consult was obtained .
The cardiology service simply recommended increasing the beta-blockade and maximizing the patient 's electrolyte status .
On 06-29 , the patient was transferred to the medical service .
Pt 's vancomycin was stopped after 14 days of treatment .
HIV test was found to be negative .
MRI head was obtained to further w/u patient 's apparent cognitive decline .
MRI showed prominent sulci and enlarged ventricles abnormal for the patient 's age .
Due to concerns for dementia , neurology consult was obtained .
Neurology felt that the patient 's cognitive symptoms were consistent w/ metabolic encephalopathy due to his multiple medical problems .
They felt that his mental status would improve as his health improved .
Underlying dementia was possible but difficult to assess with an overlying delerium .
The patient continued to pull out his doboff tube .
Pt had EGD performed to evaluate his poor nutritional status .
He was found to have a large gastric ulcer and high dose PPI was started .
The gastric biopsy and the serology were both negative for H. pylori .
PEG placement was unsuccessful by GI due to the patient 's anantomy .
07-05 the patient had a J tube placed in interventional radiology for nutritional support .
He was re-started on tube feeds .
07-06 patient failed a repeat swallow evaluation due to discoordinated swallow .
07-07 the patient was taken for colonoscopy and found to have a normal colon to cecum .
07-12 the patient was found to be C diff positive and was started on 14 day course of Flagyl .
On 07-18 , as his mental status improved , he did well at the bed side swall evaluation .
On 07-19 , he underwent video swallow evaluation and was able to tolerate ground consistent food and thin liquids .
His meds should be crushed and mixed with puree thick liquid .
He has gained 30 lb since the tubefeed was initiated ( 70 lb to 100 lb ) during this admission .
He will still need to be on tubefeed to support his nutrition until he is cleared by a nutritionist .
In terms of his mental status , he continued to improve steadily over the last few weeks of his hospital stay .
He was more alert and engaged with activity .
He did much better with PT and OT at the end after his mental status improved .
As noted above , his mental status change was likely toxic-metabolic from acute infection .
He started to develop more pain around the right stump since 07-17 .
He was seen by the vascular surgery who felt that he is too medically sick and malnourished to have surgery at this time .
He will follow up with Dr. Javier as outpatient .
Initially , his pain was controlled with titrating up the Oxycontin .
However , it was titrated too quickly from 10 mg bid to 30 mg bid .
He then developed urinary retention requiring foley placement .
After he passed the video swallowing , he was tolerating ground consistent solids .
On 07-24 , he had an emesis x 1 , and had aspiration pneumonia ( + interstital markings on the left on CXR , fever , leukocytosis ) .
His Flagyl course was extended , and Vanc / Levo were added .
His sputum showed many GPC which later grew Staph aureus .
Given his recent MRSA pneumonia , he will be treated with 2 week course of Vanc / Levo / Flagyl .
He was seen by the pain service who recommended to discontinue Oxycontin , and start Neurontin , MSIR , and lidocaine patch in addition to the standing Tylenol .
On 07-25 , his J-tube was noted to be obstructed but was able to be flushed by IR on 07-26 .
Tubefeed was resumed without any difficulty since .
Since oxycontin was discontinued , the foley was removed on 07-27 and was able to void without any difficulty .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 28 - year-old , gravida 3 , para 1 , at approximately 27 weeks gestation , who was admitted on 2014-05-12 due to increasing symptoms of congestive heart failure .
She has known dilated cardiomyopathy with a baseline ejection fraction of approximately 25% .
She had been managed as an outpatient during her pregnancy and was on multiple medications including Lasix 40 mg daily , Hydralazine 25 mg daily , Toprol XL 100 mg daily , digoxin 0.5 mg daily and Lovenox 40 mg twice daily subcutaneously .
She also took albuterol on a p.r.n. basis for her asthma .
She has known allergy to penicillin , vancomycin and erythromycin .
She was evaluated upon presentation by the Maternal Fetal Medicine attending on call as well as by Cardiology .
She was found to have symptoms of congestive heart failure as well as decreased fetal movement .
Fetal monitoring initially on admission was appropriate for gestational age .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical exam , she was noted to have bilateral lower extremity edema , mildly elevated pressures in the 140 to 150/90 range , and jugular venous distension .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After consultation with Cardiology as well as Anesthesia on call that evening , it was decided to transfer the patient to the ICU for intensive monitoring .
Central IV access was obtained .
The patient was carefully diuresed over the next 48 hours .
Symptoms of congestive heart failure gradually abated over the next 48 to 72 hours .
The patient was given antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity .
A Neonatology consultation was obtained during the course of the hospitalization .
After discussion , it was decided to attempt to obtain 28 weeks gestation and then deliver electively by cesarean section given the decompensation in the third trimester .
The patient underwent primary low transverse cesarean section on 2014-05-19 at approximately 28 weeks gestation .
The cesarean section was performed on the West Campus in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Suite .
This was performed in this location in case any acute cardiac decompensation occurred during the time of cesarean section .
Cardiothoracic Surgery was on standby during the surgery .
The patient went to the cardiac Intensive Care Unit on the West Campus postoperatively .
She did well during the postoperative period .
She required several episodes of diuresis due to increasing shortness of breath on postoperative day #1 and postoperative day #2 due to worsening symptoms of shortness of breath from fluid shifts that normally occur during the postpartum period .
The patient was transferred to the West Campus on postoperative day #2 in stable condition .
She did well during the remainder of her postoperative course and was continued on her medication regimen that she had been on during the antepartum period .
She was discharged to home on postoperative day #4 .
She was to followup with Maternal Fetal Medicine in 5 to 7 days .
She had followup with her primary cardiologist in Shaugnessy-Kaplan Rehab Hospital scheduled for 1 week postoperatively .
Of note , the patient also underwent tubal ligation at the time of cesarean section .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Toprol XL 100 mg daily , Hydralazine 25 mg daily , Lasix 40 mg twice a day , digoxin 0.75 mg daily , Lovenox 40 mg twice daily subcutaneously and albuterol p.r.n.

DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
1-3-94
DISCHARGE DATE :
1-9-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Mediastinal tumor mass .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
History of colon cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , obesity , hypertension , history of myocardial infarction .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
January 3 , 1994 , median sternotomy with mediastinal exploration , radical resection of tumor and aortopulmonary window ; partial resection of adjacent lung , en bloc resection of vagus and phrenic nerves ; partial pericardectomy ; fiberoptic bronchoscopy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region , who presents for bronchoscopy , mediastinal exploration and resection .
The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 .
In December of 1992 , she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke &apos;s grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative .
She received postoperative chemotherapy .
In September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .
The exploratory laparotomy was negative .
She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .
In September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .
In December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .
She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .
She also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , previous myocardial infarction in 1983 , hypothyroidism , history of breast cancer and history of colon cancer .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The past surgical history is notable for a 1971 mastectomy on the right , 1937 appendectomy , 1991 cholecystectomy , 1992 transverse colectomy , 1992 exploratory laparotomy , 1991 bilateral cataract surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Levoxine 0.125 mg PO q.day , Vasotec 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Maxzide 75/50 , 30 mg PO q.day .
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to sulfa .
HABITS :
50 pack year smoking history , still smoking currently .
Ethanol :
none .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , she is an obese white female in no acute distress with a hoarse voice .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination shows that she is normocephalic , atraumatic , extra ocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , and the oropharynx was clear , neck was supple without lymphadenopathy , either axillary or supraclavicular .
Chest is clear with decreased breath sounds at the left base .
She has a previous right mastectomy .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm , without murmur , rub or gallop .
Abdomen :
obese with multiple well healed surgical incisions , positive bowel sounds .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative without masses .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The neurological examination is nonfocal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on January 3 , 1994 where she underwent a median sternotomy with removal of her mediastinal mass .
This mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology .
The frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma , metastatic disease from the colon most likely .
She had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room , for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion .
This tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation .
This additional chest tube was removed the following day .
Her postoperative hematocrit was 31 , compared to a preoperative level of 43 .
Her postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable .
Mediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day six .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Percocet for pain .
Follow up with Dr. Fede Duhenile .
She will have a home health aide to visit and help her with meals .

Dr. **NAME[UUU TTT] , MD
FINAL DIAGNOSES :
1. Acute non-Q wave myocardial infarction which began on the evening of **DATE[Oct 27 2007] .
2. Severe multivessel coronary artery disease .
3. The patient has a history of 5 previous myocardial infarctions .
4. In **DATE[Apr 2005] , the patient underwent multivessel coronary artery bypass surgery .
5. The patient had several coronary interventions done prior to his bypass surgery in 2004 .
6. Hypertension , treated .
7. Hypercholesterolemia .
8. Hypothyroidism .
9. Persistent tobacco abuse .
10. Status post cervical laminectomy .
11. The patient is relatively noncompliant .
HISTORY :
This patient is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old gentleman with severe premature coronary artery disease .
Apparently , his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of **AGE[in 40s] , and he had a brother who also suffered a myocardial infarction at 48 .
All the siblings in the family have a history of hypertension .
This patient developed a symptomatic coronary artery disease several years ago .
He had coronary stents placed by another cardiologist but neither apparently maintained satisfactory patency and subsequently , the patient underwent multivessel bypass surgery in **DATE[Apr 2005] .
We were told it was 7 - vessel bypass surgery but the exact grafts were not currently available .
The patient developed chest pain on the evening of **DATE[Oct 21 2007] .
It began at rest .
It was fairly significant .
He presented to the emergency room where his first enzymes were really not elevated but the patient had ST - T wave changes in the lateral leads of the electrocardiogram .
Subsequent to that , he was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Please check the admitting note .
There are no additions to that note .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission to the hospital , the patient was started on heparin and oral Plavix or clopidogrel .
He had a repeat troponin I done at 10:30 a.m. on **DATE[Oct 22 2007] , and that clearly showed a marked elevation in his troponin to 17.5 .
For that reason , a decision was made to take the patient to the catheterization laboratory .
The patient went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on **DATE[Oct 22 2007] .
Despite his very ominous finding past medical history including the history of five previous myocardial infarctions , this patient still has an ejection fraction estimated at 50% .
His grafts include the following :
The patient has a patent sequential LIMA to the diagonal and to a left anterior descending artery .
No progression of the disease in the native left anterior descending artery beyond this LIMA graft .
He has a dominant circumflex artery .
There is a totally occluded vein graft to a medium sized ramus intermedius artery .
This is presumably the acute event .
He had a patent vein graft to fairly large obtuse marginal artery but this obtuse marginal artery had proximal 80% stenosis which prevented adequate retrograde filling of the dominant circumflex artery .
The same circumflex artery has a long segmental distal 80% stenosis which is a critical lesion which will require attention in the near future .
The right coronary artery is a codominant vessel in that it supplies a small posterior descending branch .
There is a remote stent in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery which has abruptly occluded shortly after the stent .
There is a small vein graft into a right ventricular branch which sends some collaterals to the distal portion of the occluded right coronary artery but the amount of collateralization is not very prominent .
Finally , a prominent proximal conus branch which is fairly large caliber vessel has segmental 90% lesions .
On this occasion , we were able to reopen the totally occluded vein graft to the ramus intermedius artery .
This graft was filled with thrombus .
We had to use a thrombectomy catheter with multiple passes before I put in 2 sequential Taxus 3.5 mm drug eluting stents with good results in the graft but this vein graft has distal anastomotic 50% stenosis .
The patient had adequate flow through the vein graft into the obtuse marginal artery .
He was treated with intravenous eptifibatide and continued on potent antiplatelet agents .
The day after the procedure , he was completely asymptomatic even with ambulation in the hall and was chomping at the bid to go home .
He has normal sinus rhythm at 74 per minute .
His total CPK peaked at 482 with an MB fraction that peaked at 23.7.
This would fit with the fact that the ramus intermedius artery is not a very large vessel and even occlusion of this vessel would not be expected to produce a large infarct .
The patient will be allowed to go home on a good medical therapy , and he will follow up in 3 to 4 weeks at which time I will reassess the stented vein graft , and I plan on putting a drug eluting stent in the distal portion of the dominant circumflex artery as this is the more worrisome lesion with his current anatomy .
The patient actually forgot to tell the staff when I came in that he was on thyroid replacement therapy , so he did not get his medicine for a couple of days .
When I mentioned this to he and his girlfriend , I got the impression he had not been taking it faithfully at home .
This may account for the fact that his lipids have been too elevated .
In addition , the patient was back to smoking cigarettes and tells me he has now stopped smoking completely .
I hope that he sticks to that resolution as this patient has fairly significant diffuse disease and if the progression is not stopped , his long - term outlook will be guarded .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
The discharge medications on this occasion are the following :
1. Acetaminophen 650 mg p.r.n.
2. Enteric - coated aspirin 325 mg daily .
3. Plavix 75 mg daily .
4. Lipitor 80 mg daily .
5. Add omega-3 fish oil supplement 2000 mg daily .
6. Add lisinopril 10 mg daily at bedtime .
7. Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d.
8. Multivitamin 1 daily .
9. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg tablet sublingually p.r.n.
10. Protonix 40 mg daily or omeprazole 20 mg daily as needed for reflux esophagitis .
Because of the institution of lisinopril , he will need to check his BUN , creatinine and electrolytes in 2 to 3 weeks .
ACTIVITY :
I told the patient he could not return to work or do heavy lifting until he returns to get stenting of the circumflex artery which will be approximately 3 weeks .
I made it a point to explain to him the importance of taking his medicines exactly as prescribed and to stop smoking cigarettes completely .

Medical management :
Ms. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old lady who was admitted through the emergency room from **INSTITUTION where she has been residing since **DATE[Feb 4 2007] , after a 9 - day hospitalization at **INSTITUTION for a GI bleed , DVT , and presumed sepsis of unknown origin .
She was in her usual state of health the morning before admission , but while undergoing physical therapy , she was found to be tachycardic with a pulse rate of 120 .
She stated that she felt unwell but had no specific complaints of dyspnea , chest pain , nausea , vomiting , or abdominal pain .
She appeared to be dyspneic .
When the pulse oximetry was done , she was found to be in 85% saturation on room air .
Her blood pressure was also low at 88/50 .
So she presented to the ED in **INSTITUTION hospital with tachycardia , tachypnea , hypotension and hypoxia ; given her presentation it was suspected that she was uroseptic , given + for UTI .
Based on this diagnosis she was started on zosyn IV and admitted to the hospital .
In the CXR it showed to have a total opacification of left lung ( white lung ) , that raised the question of large pleural effusion vs PNA .
A CT was done and showed large pleural effusion in that left lung , we decided to tap the site to get fluid samples and get some improvement of her respiratory status .
The samples were sent but the lab used the samples for LDH and protein levels and there was not enough for cytology or cultures .
A pigtail was placed which drained a total of 2 L , after 24 h of not draining any material , we decided to pull the tube out .
A Second CT was done but this time of chest , abdomen and pelvis , this one showed a big mass in the pelvis complatible with bladder carcinoma and involvement of multiple nodules in peritoneum and retroperitoneal , also left pleural metastases and right lung nodules .
After this findings we contacted the family and given the advanced stage of her disease we adviced them that the best course of action would be make the patient CMO and send her to a nursing home with hospice care , the family agreed and today she is going to be transfered to a nursing facility for hospice care .
The patient is very comfortable and she is not requiring any pain medications so far .
She is still in O2 6L , stable .
CT showed :
CHEST :
1. MULTIPLE ENHANCING LEFT PLEURAL METASTASES WITH LARGE LOCULATED LEFT EFFUSION , ENLARGED RIGHT HILAR NODE , AND SEVERAL RIGHT LUNG
NODULES , LIKELY SECONDARY TO METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER .
2. MASSIVELY ENLARGED THYROID GLAND WITH MULTIPLE NODULES SECONDARY TO GOITER .
ABDOMEN :
1. MULTIPLE METASTASES TO THE PERITONEUM , RETROPERITONEAL NODES AND LEFT COMMON ILIAC NODES COMPATIBLE WITH METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER .
2. IVC FILTER .
PELVIS :
1. MASSIVE TUMOR INVOLVING THE BLADDER .
2. BILATERAL COMMON FEMORAL DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS WITH CATHETER INSERTED VIA THE LEFT FEMORAL VEIN .

DEATH SUMMARY
DATE OF DEATH :
**DATE[Mar 31 2007] .
CAUSE OF DEATH :
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , end stage .
BRIEF HOSPICE COURSE :
Ms. **NAME[AAA] was an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female who was admitted on **DATE[Mar 12 2007] , and found to have pneumonia as well as concurrent end - stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
The patient was started on Pseudomonas for treatment of her right lower lobe pneumonia .
However , her hospital course was complicated by a GI bleed , requiring 12 units of PRBCs transfusion .
The patient continued to deteriorate throughout her hospital course and became weaker , and it was clear that her COPD was end stage .
Therefore , hospice was recommended , and the patient was transferred to hospice on **DATE[Mar 30 2007] , after full discussion with the patient 's family and medical staff and care providers .
Once transferred to hospice , the patient was managed on the principles of comfort measures only .
Her respiratory status continued to worsen , and her overall condition continued to deteriorate .
The patient was eventually placed on continuous IV infusion of morphine for comfort .
On **DATE[Mar 31 2007] , the nurse notified the **NAME[VVV] MD regarding the patient 's clinical condition .
Dr. **NAME[UUU] examined the patient at bedside , and findings were significant for no respiration , no pulse , and negative corneal reflex .
The patient ceased to breathe at 12:30 p.m. on **DATE[Mar 31 2007] , and her death certificate was signed and dated at that time .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Oct 28 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 01 07]
I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male , who is status post laparoscopic colectomy for colonic polys .
This in the setting of ischemic heart disease with some moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as hypertension and history of mechanical mitral valve .
His preoperative fluid management has been difficulty and postoperatively he was transferred to the intensive care , intubated , sedated and mechanically ventilated .
I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed his laboratory , radiographic and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the surgeons and Critical Care Team .
The problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure :
Chest x-ray shows a pulmonary artery catheter and endotracheal tube in reasonable position .
He does have some signs of volume overload with pulmonary vascular congestion on the ventilator right now .
His gas exchange is good at 40% FIO2 and 5 of PEEP the current assist control settings .
My plan is to leave him sedated .
He is in a primarily narcotic based sedative regimen over the course of the evening with no plans on ventilatory weaning until after we have a better feel for his hemodynamics .
2. Ischemic heart disease and status post mitral valve repair :
His PA catheter is showing pressures of about 55/30 and I suspect that he has chronic pulmonary hypertension , given these numbers .
Cardiac index is around 2.2 with a mixed venous oxygen saturation of around 58% .
His lactate is less than 2 .
On exam , his toes although not cold and reasonably well - perfused with reasonable distal pulses in the dorsalis pedis and other extremities are reasonably well-perfused as well .
Given the fluid overload on the chest x-ray , the central venous pressure in the mid 20s and the pulmonary hypertension , I have elected to start empiric diuresis this evening while maintaining an adequate cardiac output .
I instructed the bedside nurses to follow cardiac outputs on a q.2 hourly basis with mixed venous oxygen saturations .
I have started him on a Lasix infusion in order to try and get some excess fluid off him after his operation .
3. ICU Prophylaxis :
He has some stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
I have started him on some glycemic control .
TOTAL CRITICAL CARE TIME EQUALS 40 MINUTES .

History of Present Illness :
57 yo right handed male with seizure history since 1988 , s/p craniotomies x 3 ( most recently 05-05 ) for oligodendroglioma .
The patient began having generalized tonic - clonic seizures in 1988 , which at the time were thought to be related to asthma medications .
At this time , his head CT was negative , and he was treated with Dilantin and Phenobarbital .
However , he continued to have left arm focal motor seizures and problems thinking .
In 2001-08-31 he stopped his medication and had a generalized tonic - clonic seizure in 12/94 .
He was diagnosed by biopsy with oligodendroglioma , and gross total resection by Dr. Redner in
95 revealed a low-grade oligodendroglioma .
He was followed by Dr. Gregory Dumas , with serial MRI 's.
In 2011-05-02 , he was requiring more ativan to control his seizures , and was increasingly disoriented and forgetful with headaches .
He had a repeat total resection in 4/04 by Dr. Peter Hoadley at Hallmark Health System which revealed anaplastic oligodendroglioma grade III .
He had radiation following the resection and was doing well on monthly Temodar until 2012-04-23 when he had a marked change in behavior , his balance was off , speech slurred , and he had difficulty using the computer .
A head MRI on 2012-04-24 revealed increasing tumor infiltration with increased edema and mass effect .
He underwent a right craniotomy with resection and gliadel wafers on 2012-05-02 at Hallmark Health System by Dr. Ackley .
Came for neurosurgery follow up on 05-21 , and had been having clear fluid leaking from his incision , as well as frontal headache , imbalance , bumping into things with his left leg and worsening tremors .
He was admitted for Lumbar drain placement

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
coronary artery disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Ischemic cardiomyopathy , orthotopic heart transplantation , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , coronary graft disease , medical noncompliance .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac echocardiogram .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Vessels is a 49-year-old man status post orthotopic heart transplantation in 1991 at Dautenorwe Stuart Erec Hillpa Of Hospital who is admitted with dyspnea and severe heart failure .
Mr. Vessels &apos;s postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so .
Recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in January 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis .
A repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease .
A biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils .
He was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil .
Chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly .
Prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure .
An echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease , coronary allograft vasculopathy , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease , CMV infection , hypertension , depression , and tricuspid regurgitation .
Examination revealed a tired , fatigued man with cool extremities .
His blood pressure is 130/80 and heart rate was 100. jugular venous pressure was increasing .
Carotids were 2+ .
Crackles were increased 1/4 of the way up .
There was a left ventricular heave and an S3 galop .
The abdomen was soft and nontender with a palpable liver edge and the pulses were diminished .
LABORATORY DATA :
Revealed a sodium 136 , potassium 4.5 , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 , glucose 136. hematocrit 40% .
The electrocardiogram revealed poor R wave progression and marked decrease in all volts .
chest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary vessels and enlarged heart .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed .
The echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction .
Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy .
The patient diuresed and responded to Lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed .
At 4:30 AM the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest .
Despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated .
Upon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and CPR was being performed .
The rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure .
There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions .
A pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid .
A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure .
In total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate .
The resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 AM and were begun at 3:38 AM .
The patient was pronounced dead .
Patient &apos;s mother was informed by Dr. Vessels .
An autopsy permission was granted .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Oct 28 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 02 07]
I am managing this critically - ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male who is status post laparoscopic colon infection in the setting of severe ischemic heart disease with a cardiomyopathy status post mitral valve replacement and pulmonary hypertension .
I am seeing him for management of his respiratory insufficiency , ischemic cardiomyopathy , pulmonary hypertension , and fluid overload .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiograph intake data , and discussed the management with the general surgeons .
The problems and their management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure :
A chest x-ray shows pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral effusions in the tracheal tube and pulmonary artery catheter in good position .
The PA pressures are in the 45-60 range over 20s .
Today , I have discontinued his propofol drip , cut his fentanyl drip in half , and after a two hour pressure support have been able to wean and extubate him .
Subsequently , I have discontinued his fentanyl completely and left him on intermittent doses of narcotics for pain control .
He will need to stay in the intensive care unit for pulmonary toileting .
2. Ischemic heart disease :
**PLACE , PA pressures have been relatively high , but stable over the course of the evening after extubation .
His PA pressures have increased with PA systolics in the 70s and 80s and central venous pressures around 8 .
His heart rate is gone from the 70s to the 90s .
Cardiac output has increased as well and is currently about 7.5 liters with a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 74% .
Given the fact that he appears to maintain adequate forward flow despite the elevation in his pulmonary artery pressures , I have decided to gradually diurese him over the course the day .
I have left him on a Lasix drip , which I am titrating up in order to make sure he remains overall net negative .
I have started some gentle beta blockade in light of his adequate cardiac output as well and we will try to get his heart rate down today .
Currently , he remains off heparin , but will need to be reanticoagulated shortly in light of his decreased left ventricular function and his mitral valve .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Jan 12 2008]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Jan 15 08]
I personally interviewed and examined the patient on **DATE[Jan 15 2008] .
I discussed the case with Dr. **NAME[TTT] .
Please consider my note linked to Dr. **NAME[TTT] 's .
Reviewed the patient 's history and physical and hospital course since admission .
The patient has a history of dementia , was living in a nursing home .
He developed a cool left foot and was transferred here for possible ischemic disease .
He was found , however , to have deep venous thrombosis as an explanation for this complaint .
The patient was also found to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and has been evaluated by Cardiology .
His ventricular response has been well controlled with a beta blocker , but he did have an episode of hypotension last night .
The patient is unable to provide any additional history .
He is minimally responsive today ( which appears to be near his baseline ) and does not have any specific complaints .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is arousable but does not answer questions .
Head :
Normocephalic .
Eyes :
PERRLA .
Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion .
Heart :
Regular rhythm .
Abdomen is soft .
Extremities :
He has mottling of the left leg with minimal edema .
His right leg appears normal .
LABORATORY STUDIES :
Include today a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 115 , CO2 28 , BUN 53 , and creatinine 1.3 .
His glucoses have been reasonably well controlled .
Calcium today is 10.6 , magnesium 1.4 , and phosphate 2.2 .
White count today 12,100 .
Hemoglobin 8.8 and hematocrit 25.2 .
His hematocrit on **DATE[Jan 14 2008] , at 4 a.m. was 32.7 ; that was 29 at 6 p.m. on **DATE[Jan 14 2008] , and 7:15 p.m. on **DATE[Jan 14 2008] and as mentioned 25.2 at 3:30 this morning .
His platelet count is 135,000 .
INR is 1.3 .
He is receiving Coumadin hair therapy and heparin .
His PTT today is 65.4 , which is in the therapeutic range .
Blood culture performed on **DATE[Jan 14 2008] , is negative at this time .
The patient is stable , but he does have a modest decrease in his hemoglobin .
We will repeat that later today .
If he does have ongoing bleeding , we may need to consider stopping his anticoagulation and placing an inferior vena cava interruption device .
However , if possible , I will prefer not to do that .
There is no gross evidence of external bleeding or internal bleeding at this time .
We will continue to monitor him for further signs of decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit .
The patient is not a candidate for cardioversion as he appears to be asymptomatic and is already anticoagulated .
This would be another reason to try to keep him on anticoagulant therapy .

FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
Cervical carcinoma ; bilateral ureteral obstruction secondary to the cancer .
Uremia .
Ileus .
OPERATION :
Bilateral ureteral stent placement .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 78-year-old woman had stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix and she has known periaortic and splenic metastases .
She was discharged from the hospital about 18 days prior to her admission , following a month long stay .
When her cancer was diagnosed , she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
She had extensive disease of the uterus , ovarian tubes , omentum and the periaortic lymph nodes .
Postoperatively , she developed ileus , then finally she recovered and she was discharged to the nursing home .
She was readmitted because of a problem with uremia and high BUN and creatinine when she seen in the office and the BUN and creatinine was ordered .
The BUN was 70 and creatinine was 4.6 and for this reason she had ultrasound of the kidney which showed bilateral hydronephrosis .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for ureteral stent placement .
On the day of admission , she was generally stable and she had no evidence of disease in the pelvis , no bleeding and no other abnormality .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. Jescdrig was called and a consultation was done and he placed bilateral ureteral stents in her kidneys .
Postoperatively , she diuresed very well .
She had dropped her BUN and creatinine to normal and she was found to have may be metastatic disease to her skin on the right paraumbilical area .
Because of her age and mental condition and the fact that she had cerebral atrophy , the decision was made for comfort unless she has any further problem and no further chemotherapy or treatment will be given .
The possibility that she may need to receive radiation therapy to this area to prevent her from getting further obstruction was also brought up .
Her family felt that at the present time , because her condition was no good , they would like to just take her home so that she could enjoy the quality of life .
Indeed , at the time of discharge she was conscious and she was cooperative and she was able to communicate very nicely with everyone including her family , except for the mental instability that she had because of her cerebral atrophy due to senility .
FOLLOW-UP :
She will be followed in the Centu Fairgmer Queen Medical Center .

CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION NOTE :
INDICATION :
CARDIOPULMONARY COLLAPSE .
Phoned to Condition A on 10 South .
ACLS protocol was started immediately .
CPR was underway .
The initial rhythm was PEA and then subsequently asystole and then ventricular fibrillation .
The patient was given a total of 4 mg of epinephrine .
He was given 40 units of vasopressin and was shocked five times .
The first time was 150 joules and then subsequently 200 joules .
The patient was treated empirically for hyperkalemia and was given one gram of calcium chloride and was given twice .
He was also given indulin and D50 and was given sodium bicarbonate .
CPR was continued throughout .
He had a nice femoral pulse with the CPR ; however , once the CPR stopped , the patient did not have any pulse .
Due to the futility of care , it was felt that the effort for resuscitation should be stopped .
No objection was made in the room from the physicians or the nursing staff , so we stopped resuscitation .
Time of death was 22:28 .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
75 yo F s/p MIx4 , numerous cath , PAF , Inducible VTach s/p AICD and pacer with severe COPD / restrictive lung disease s/p fall with intertrochanteric fracture .
As per CMED CCU , pt requires emergent repair of intertrochanteric fracture to preserve neurovascular function .
Pt is a moderate risk for a needed emergent non-cardiac procedure .
Pt is medically cleared for procedure  , likely has some mile rate related ischemia .
1. Cards :
--- Pre-op B-blocker with goal HR < 70
--- No real utility in MIBI / cath prior to procedure gien previous caths with no significant lesions to be intervened on .
--- V-Tach : pt has AICD in place , however b-blocker should contorl Vtach for now .
--- B-blocker IV , Dilt PRN for PAF
--- Hold coumadin for afib given hx of upper GIB and surgery in AM
--- Continue ASA , plavix
--- ROMI , check AM ECG
2. COPD / Restrictive lung disease :
--- Nebs / MDI PRN
--- no need for steroids now
--- expect prolonged wean given previous history of prolonged wean s/p colonic resection
--- incentive spirometry for atelectasis
3. Hip fracture :
--- pain control with diluadid , tylenol
--- lovenox tonight x1 , hold AM dose per CMED CCU
--- Pt to OR in early AM

CMED course :
ORIF with repair of neck fracture 2016-03-23 .
Had expected prolonged post-op extubation in PACU given COPD history , as with colon CA resection surgery .
In PM extubated , transferred to floor 2016-03-23 .
Late 03-23 found with afib and RVR , given beta blocker with min. response , started dilt. drip .
Received 2 mg dilaudid for pain o/n .
On 03-24 AM p/w with respiratory failure , continued tachycardia on dilt. gtt.
Transferred to unit and urgently intubated .
Of note , there was a question of misplaced NGT .
When NGT tube was pulled out , it was noted to have respiratory-like secretions .
Concern for aspiration of mediations to lungs .
However , evaluation of CXR revealed NGT coiled in esophagus .
Pt 's respiratory distress is most likely on setting of aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis in the setting of depressed mental status secondary to post-operative narcotics .
Pt was pan-cultured and switched from unasyn ( started at OSH for foot ulcer ) to zosyn .
Vanco was added for possible nosocomial infection .
CTA was performed which was negative for PE , but revealed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities c/w aspiration vs. pneumonia vs. edema .
Pt was weaned down on ventilator , minimal secretions noted .
On 03-27 , pt was noted to have depressed mental status off all sedating medications ; mental status improved over the course of the day .
Pt was diuresed .
Atrial fibrillation was rate-controlled on dilt drip .
Dilt drip was discontinued and metoprolol titrated up .
Cardiac enzymes were cycled in setting of rapid AF and were flat .
Initially , pt was noted to be dry with low FeNa and given IVF .
Then , noted to be volume overloaded and diuresed with lasix .
Pt had depressed mental status on transfer to CMED in setting of narcotics .
She was then started on propofol while intubated .
Head CT was negative for acute bleed , mass effect , or stroke .
Mental status improved during times when propofol was held .
On 03-27 , pt was noted to have significantly depressed M.S. off propol improved off sedation .
All sedating medications including prn narcotics were held and mental status cleared somewhat .
s/p hip fx repair : started on lovenox for anti-coagulation .
Given standing NSAID , tylenol for pain control .
opiates used very sparingly in setting of MS change
On transfer to floor team from CMED active issues and plan included :
Resp failure / COPD :
Initially got steroids upon intubation .
Off for days now .
Extubated on 03-31 .
Still tachypneic and hypoxic on room air .
Lung sounds fairly clear .
? COPD vs atelectasis as cause of hypoxia .
On Blake , Nancy pe less likely
- atrovent standing .
prn albuterol only given A fib with RVR
- inhaled steroids
- obtaining pcp set of Reginald
Fever :
In the ICU .
Had received unasyn , vanc , zosyn during hospital course for cellulitis and other unclear reasons , including possible vent associated pna .
No true source found .
Afebrile > 24 hours off abx .
- culture if spikes .
No abx unless source found
a.fib with RVR - Has ppm , so can have lot of nodal agents .
Now rate controlled on metop 125 tid and dilt .
30 QID .
Titrate prn .
- continue nodal agents
- consider anti coag for cva prevention , but wait until ambulating better
CAD : on asa , b blocker , ace .
No statin .
need to clear with family
Heme - anemic .
Unclear baseline .
Possible anemia 03-02 operative blood loss .
Follow hct daily Goal > 28
Neck : never had c spine cleared by neurosurg .
Had fall pta with ? fx on initial CT , neg fx on f/u ct .
- flex / ext films done
- will clear with neursurg prior to removing hard collar
Overnight on pt 's first evening on the floor , she had episode of desaturation with inc O2 requirement ( 4L -> 6L -> sating 91% on NRB ) - CXR with worsening - non responsive to lasix .
Family meeting held and pt made clear wishes after extubation that she does not want to be intubated again and made DNR / DNI .
No BIPAP .
Now pt lethargic and min responsive .
All four children in pts room and agree on CMO - want to d/c c-collar and start morphine ggt .
Discussed with night float cover Dr. Dennis COmmander and Dr. Mike French .
Although Dr. Ray will be covering pt today , Dr. Stephanie Wilson spoke with family this morning and has noted that pt is CMO .

05/02/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
adult respiratory distress syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
acute renal insufficiency .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post a four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1983 , pulmonary hypertension , hepatitis C positive cirrhosis history with history of portal hypertension and status post an upper gastrointestinal bleed on 4-10-98 , who presents from Sondi Memorial for work up of pulmonary infiltrates , acute renal failure and pulmonary hypertension .
The patient presented to Sondi Memorial on 4-10-98 with fatigue and fall , found to have a hematocrit of 29 , baseline 37 .
The patient was transfused two units and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done where it showed gastritis , candidal esophagitis and portal hypertensive gastropathy without varices .
A colonoscopy showed anteriordysplasia , no bleeding was seen .
The patient was discharged after one week on iron sulfate .
On 4-24 , the patient was seen again at Sondi Memorial when he experienced at home a fall , no loss of consciousness , positive substernal chest pain , pleuritic pain , shortness of breath and cough .
He went to Sondi Memorial where he ruled out for myocardial infarction and was found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate / pneumonia , started on cefuroxime .
His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate despite aggressive chest physical therapy for possible blood , given Lasix for congestive heart failure , became hypotensive , hypoxic and intubated .
The patient was found to have expanding pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray , developed acute renal insufficiency with minimal urine output , less than 10 cc an hour , started on dopamine for hemodynamic instability .
An echocardiogram was obtained on 4-26 which showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal _____ left ventricular function , severe right ventricular dilatation with septal hypokinesis and flattening with a question of right ventricular apical clot raised with mild aortic stenosis , severe tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure of approximately 70 millimeters , consistent with fairly severe pulmonary hypertension .
Blood cultures x two sent off with no growth .
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with flat creatine kinases and he was sent to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for further work up .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
At the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital he was quite hypotensive , requiring dopamine at 1,000 , Levo at 12 .
His chest x-ray showed diffuse patchy infiltrates on left lung with left upper lung patchy infiltrates and right hemidiaphragm elevated , consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome from possible pneumonia .
A urinalysis was obtained which showed blood , urine sediment was active with positive dysmorphic cells , red cell casts , and 1+ albumin with mild protein uria .
The patient had ANCA , anti-GBM , anti-streptolycin , ANA , UPEP , SPEP , renal ultrasound , hepatitis C cryoglobulin sent out .
He had a bronchoscopy immediately done which showed no fresh blood , just old clot and a pulmonary arterial line placed in the right internal jugular vein .
Question of pulmonary-renal syndrome was raised .
The patient subsequently deteriorated over time , was started on CVVH and suffered significant complications without improvement of his pulmonary / renal situation .
A family meeting was held on 5-2-98 and it was decided that the patient should be made comfort care only .
All CVVH and the ventilator was removed and the patient spontaneously passed away on 5-2-98 , at 4:55 p.m.
Family and primary carephysician informed .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 19 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Dec 26 07]
I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male status post laparotomy and debridement in the setting of pancreatitis .
Hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure from ARDS .
I am seeing him for management of this and his multiple medical problems .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the surgical team .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory insufficiency .
Chest x-ray continues to show stable bilateral infiltrates .
Last night he was on BiPAP at a setting of 12/8 with FIO2 titrated to maintain oxygen saturations of greater than 94% .
He was unable to tolerate any time off the BiPAP yesterday .
This morning I have taken him off the BiPAP and he has done well on a nonrebreather face mask through most of the day but is becoming somewhat tachypneic later in the afternoon and I plan to place him back on BiPAP at these same settings overnight .
He is diuresing reasonably well and I have discontinued his Lasix drip and changed him to Lasix 40 mg q. 12 hourly in order to keep him overall net negative .
We will watch his BUN and creatinine closely which are at 20 and 0.7 today and his bicarbonate is up to 33 .
2. Hypertension .
I suspect that some of his hypertension is related to the weaning efforts .
He is currently on captopril , Lopressor , and clonidine for that .
3. ICU prophylaxis .
I have discontinued the fentanyl drip as he is not complaining of any pain and started him on some intermittent Dilaudid .
He is on a heparin drip for prophylaxis after his SMA repair .
I have ordered an albumin and prealbumin today to assess his nutritional status and he seems to be tolerating his tube feeds at his current rate .
Total critical care time = 40 minutes .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 56 year-old gentleman with severe aortic stenosis , reports having been told he had a heart murmur many years ago but just recently diagnosed with aortic stenosis .
He has had mild dyspnea on exertion increasing over the past couple of months prior to admission .
An echocardiogram in 2011-09-05 revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 to 25% .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Cigarette smoking .
2. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
3. Proteinuria .
4. Aortic stenosis .
5. Cellulitis .
6. Gangrene of his left second toe in 2010-06-06 followed by an amputation .
7. Left common femoral dorsalis pedis bypass graft .
8. Right leg bypass graft in 1999 .
9. Right below the knee amputation in 2008 .
ALLERGIES :
The patient states he has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS :
1. Aspirin 325 mg po q day .
2. Vasotec 7.5 mg po q day .
3. Humalog insulin sliding scale with meals and at bedtime .
4. Humulin Walters insulin 24 units subcutaneous q A.M. and 8 to 16 in the evening depending upon where his blood sugar has been .
Preoperative laboratory values were unremarkable .
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 2011-10-17 which revealed a 20% left vein osteal lesion as well as 70% LAD lesion and an 80% right coronary .
The patient was taken to the operating room on 2011-10-18 where he underwent an aortic valve replacement with #23 mm pericardial valve as well as coronary artery bypass graft times two with a LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein to the acute marginal .
Postoperatively the patient was transported to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on Milrinone , Neo-Synephrine and Levophed drip .
The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and subsequently extubated on the night of surgery .
He remained on Levophed , Milrinone and Neo-Synephrine drips and was hemodynamically stable .
N. Saez clinic consult was obtained due to hyperglycemia and the need for insulin drip in the Intensive Care Unit .
On postoperative day the Milrinone was weaned down .
The Levophed had been discontinued as the Neo-Synephrine and the patient was beginning to progress hemodynamically .
Upon discontinuation of the Milrinone the patient 's SV02 had dropped significantly in the low 50 s.
The patient had decreased exercise tolerance and therefore was placed back on his milrinone to keep his cardiac index greater than 2.0 .
Over the next couple of days it was very slowly decreased as his Ace inhibitors were increased orally .
The patient ultimately was weaned off the Milrinone , transitioned to Captopril on postoperative day five and remained hemodynamically stable .
Once the patient had remained off of inotropics for approximately 24 hours , he had been given diuretics and Ace inhibitors and remained hemodynamically stable he was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Telemetry floor on postoperative day six .
A physical therapy evaluation was obtained for assistance and mobility .
Cardiac rehabilitation was initiated at that time .
On 2011-10-24 postoperative day six consultation heart failure cardiology service was obtained .
It was their recommendation to continue Ace inhibitors , to continue daily weights , to switch the patient to a long acting beta-blocker and to enroll the patient in postoperative cardiac rehabilitation as well as to make sure the patient was on statin drugs .
These measures were all instituted .
The patient continued to progress from cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy standpoint while on the floor .
The patient remained hemodynamically stable over the next few days , continued to increase with physical therapy and ambulation .
His blood sugars were followed by the Cape Cod Hospital Clinic service and insulin has been adjusted accordingly .
Today , 2011-10-31 , postoperative day 13 the patient remains stable and ready for discharge to home .
The patient 's condition today is as follows :
Temperature 96.9 F , pulse 84 , respiratory rate 18 , blood pressure 106/59 .
Most recent laboratory values are from 2011-10-25 which revealed a white blood cell count 8.4000 , hematocrit 35 , platelet count 202,000. Sodium 133 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 93 , CO2 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.7 , glucose 198 .
The patient 's finger stick blood glucose levels range from 151 to 390 over the past 24 hours and his insulin scale has been adjusted upward to compensate for that .
Neurologically the patient is grossly intact .
Pulmonary exam he is clear upper lobes , diminished bilateral bases left greater than right .
Coronary exam is regular rate and rhythm .
His abdomen is benign .
His sternum is stable. His incision is clean and dry Steri Strips intact .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Factor is a 76 year old white male with acute inferior myocardial infarction , who was urgently transferred by Dr. Lenni Factor for cardiac catheterization and possible angioplasty .
His only cardiac risk factor includes hypertension .
The night of Oct 14 , 1999 the patient developed chest discomfort associated with shortness of breath .
On October 15 , 1999 at 6 AM the patient was admitted to No Verlmerver Medical Center .
An electrocardiogram showed acute inferior myocardial infarction .
Due to unknown duration of the chest pain the patient wastransferred urgently to the TGCHO for cardiac catheterization .
Shortly after Aggrastat was started , the patient became pain free .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension and gout .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 115/77 .
The heart rate 64 .
JVP 6 cm .
H20 .
Carotid upstroke was normal .
There was an S4 .
The lungs were clear .
Abdomen was benign .
Femoral and distal pulses were full .
There was no pedaledema .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
The electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at 62 beats per minute , small Qwaves in 3 and F , ST elevation in 2 , 3 , and F. ST Depression in 1 , L and V2 and 3 .
LABORATORY DATA :
Peak CPK 1117 .
Total cholesterol 142 .
LDL 56 .
HDL 30 .
Triglycerides 281 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was directly admitted to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
Coronary angiography , right heart catheterization and percutaneous intervention of the RCA were performed from the right groin without complications .
The proximal RCA was totally occluded with good left to right collaterals .
The LAD showed a 40% stenosis in the proximal segment .
The circumflex showed mild atherosclerotic .
The RCA occlusion was successfully dilated and sent using a 3.0 X 23 mm Duet with post stent dilatation up to 16 atmospheres .
Following intervention right heart catheterization was performed to rule out RV infarct .
The RA was 5 .
PA was 19/7 with a mean of 13 .
PCW was 11 .
Of note there was a clear A wave in the RV tracing , suggestive of RV infarct .
The next day the patient was quite confused and disoriented , which gradually disappeared .
An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate the LV function , which showed an ejection fraction of 53% with inferoposteriorakinesis / hypokinesis .
The next day the patient &apos;s mental status came back to baseline and he remained free of angina .

I responded to Condition A on 10 South .
Patient is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old gentleman with past medical history of dementia , peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the hospital for ischemic leg .
The patient was evaluated by Vascular Surgery and he was diagnosed with DVT with the common femoral vein .
Apparently , patient 's history was complicated by atrial fibrillation and he has been treated with calcium channel blockers .
Apparently , just prior to calling the code , the patient became bradycardic on the monitor and the code was called .
On our arrival , the patient was unresponsive and he was treated using ACLS protocol , a note of which will be dictated separately .
The patient 's initial rhythm was PA , pulseless electrical activity and subsequently had rhythms of asystole , ventricular fibrillation which was resistant to treatment .
The patient was given epinephrine , a total of 5 mg .
He was given 1 mg of atropine .
He was shocked five times from 150 joules to 200 joules .
He was given calcium chloride and bicarb and also was treated for a possible hyperkalemia .
The patient was resuscitated for almost half - an - hour and the code was called off due to futility of care .
The possible causes of his cardiopulmonary arrest is pulmonary embolism , a massive myocardial infarction .
The code was called off by myself and the family were on their way to the hospital .
The medical attending and the family will be notified by the medical team .
I have told the senior resident that I will be more than happy to come and talk to the family when they arrive .
I do not think the patient is going to require an autopsy .
However , I told the medical resident that this is an option that they need to talk to the family about .
I spent a total of 30 minutes assessing , evaluating , managing Mr. **NAME[AAA] .

Pertinent Results :
CT chest 2017-02-06
IMPRESSION :
1. Extensive bilateral diffuse ground glass and more confluent areas of consolidation in both lungs consistent with the recent chest x-ray .
This non - specific pattern could represent diffuse pneumonia complicated by ARDS .
This would likely less represent asymmetric pulmonary edema .
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions .
Echo 2018-02-06
Conclusions :
1. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage .
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler .
2. Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and systolic function are normal ( LVEF > 55% ) .
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .
4. The ascending , transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque .
5. The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion .
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve .
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen .
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation .
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve .
7. No vegetation / mass is seen on the pulmonic valve .
8. There is a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion .
Head CT 2017-02-08
FINDINGS :
No intracranial hemorrhage is identified .
There is no mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures .
No major vascular territorial infarction is identified .
The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and symmetrical .
No osseous lesions are seen .
IMPRESSION :
No intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of acute infarction .
EEG 2017-02-10
IMPRESSION :
This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a low voltage and slow background consistent with a severe encephalopathy of toxic , metabolic , or anoxic etiology .
Note that with the documented movements of the patient 's head and mouth , no change on the EEG was seen .
No evidence of ongoing seizures was seen .

Brief Hospital Course :
1) Respiratory failure :
On admission , this was felt to be likely 03-15 worsening PNA .
Pt remained intubated until 2017-02-14 .
He had difficulty weaning from the vent due to difficulties with neurological status ( he remained drowsy and unresponsive for many days ) but eventually awoke enough and was extubated without difficulty and remained stable on 3L NC .
He was transferred to the floor but a few days later began to show signs of respiratory distress and was transferred back to the CMED CSRU for reintubation for likely aspiration event leading to worsening pneumonia as well as some component of pulm edema .
He was extubated a few days later and transferred back to the floor where his pulm status improved dramatically with lasix and continued nebulizer treatments .
The patient was prepared for discharge on 05-29 , when he was sat ' ing in the high 90 's on room air .
However , on 2017-03-01 at 6 am the pt was found with labored respirations ( rr = 24 ) and SaO2 89% , which improved to only SaO290 - 91% on 100% NRB .
ABG ( 7.42 / 38 / 88 ) was performed , 80 mg lasix was given and the patietn had foley placed and had good urine output and good mentation .
He was also given nebulizers without improvement .
His chest radiograph had fluffy bilateral infiltrates .
Although the pt was w/o fever , he had chills .
He was readmitted tot he CMED CSRU for respiratory distress likely secondary to a recurrent aspiration event .
He was continued on meropenem , started on BiPAP and aggressively suctioned in an attempt to avoid intubation .
On 03-02 at 10 am , the patient had an acutechange in mental status with bradycardia , hypertension , pinpoint pupils , decerebrate posturing and increased tone in bilateral upper extremities and unresponsiveness .
The patient was brought to CT immediately for stat scan and was found to have a massive occipital spontaneous hemorrhage into the L ventricle requiring ventricular drainage .
Neurosurgery was immediately called for an EVD and anesthesia was called STAT to the bedside for intubation at 10:45 am in order to assist in hyperventilation .
After endotracheal intubation , MAPs were maintained between 70 and 90 , dilantin was dose to maintain an appropriate level .
L frontal ICP bolt was placed by neurosurgery under sterile conditions on antibiotics .
Mannitol 75 mg iv x 1 then 50 gm iv tid was begun to maintain serum osm > 320 and Na > 147 .
The patient was hyperventilated to goal PCO2 30-35 with ICP improvement .
Serial head CT studies and neurologic exams were performed but the patient was unchaged , unresponsive with posturing and no spontaneous movement despite ICP being maintained in good range ( < 20 ).
On 2017-03-03 , a family meeting resulted in the patient 's code being changed to comfort measures only .
The patient was terminally extubated on a morphine drip and ativan titrated for agonal breathing and discomfort ; scopolamine was used as an adjunct to control secretions and appeared comfortable when he died at 12:27 pm on 2017-03-04 .
The family refused autopsy or post-mortem examination to deduce secondary causes of death .
2. ID - Bacteremia and PNA :
Pt 's triple lumen catheter was found to be growing coag neg staph . and PICC tip and sputum growing enterobacter cloacae .
The PICC was d/c 'ed and pt was continued on vancomycin ( for course of 6 weeks ) and meropenem was added on 02-09 ( for 3 week course ).
TEE was negative .
Pt finished the 3 week course of meropenem while in house and was discharged to rehab on day 34/42 of the vancomycin .
3) AIN :
Pt received oxacillin during his prior hospitalization and had AIN from this medication .
On this admission he was continued on prednisone taper .
Fluoroquinolones and other renal toxins were avoided .
Renal function gradually improved and Cr trended down from peak of 7.6 to 1.4 .
Before the patient acutely decompensated as above , the plan was for steroid taper :
60 mg x 10 days ( already completed ) , 40 mg x 14 d ( already completed ) , 20 mg x 14 d ( now day 11-24 ) , 10 mg x 10 d , 5 mg x 10 d .
4) Foot ulcer : The pt was followed by podiatry and had several further debridement of his R heel wound .
on abx , podiatry following , changed vac q3 days .
5) Encephalopathy : It was unclear why the pt 's mental status initially did not improve more quickly after all sedatives were removed and he was extubated .
His MS waxed and waned for many days and uremia vs. failure to clear sedatives were considered ( although pt was making urine and LFT 's are wnl ).
The pt had an EEG and 2 head CT 's which did not show anoxic brain injury or bleeding .
He gradually improved and was A&Ox3 and near baseline before Amesbury Hospital transferred to the CMED CSRU in respiratory distress .
6) DM :
Pt was maintained on SSI with small amount of standing insulin while he was NPO and then his dose was gradually increased as he received tube feeds .
7) FEN :
The pt had an NG tube placed and received tube feeds for the majority of his hospitalization .
Upon extubation and transfer to the floor he pulled out the NG tube time several times and required restraints .
Albumin was very low and pt had significant edema likely 03-15 this .
A few days before decompensating , his mental status improved to the degree that he was able to eat normal food without aspirating .
8) CV :
Pump / HTN : pt had episodes of both hypertension and hypotension during his stay .
He was managed with Metoprolol , Hydralazine , and Amlodipine .
Near discharge his BP was controlled with Metoprolol only .
9) Hypernatremia - While in the CMED CSRU the pt developed hypernatremia .
This was felt to be likely 03-15 intravascular volume depletion since the pt 's albumin was so low and he was third spacing all of his fluid .
He was volume resuscitated and managed with D5W and lasix as well as receving FW boluses with his NG tube feeds .
The hypernatremia fully resolved when he resumed eating on his own and had access to free water .
10) Anemia :
Pt 's Hct trended down slowly throughout his hospitalization .
Labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease .
He was transfused 3 units pRBC 's near the end of his hospitalization and had an appropriate bump .
11) CMED CCU :
When the pt 's MS improved to near baseline before again decompensating , he became extremely tearful and expressed feelings of depression after being in the hospital for so long .
He expressed interest in taking an anti-depressant for a short time while he was recovering and was started on Celexa .

Pulmonary edema .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , mediastinal mass , inferior myocardial infarction , bronchiectasis .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
None .
CLINICAL INFECTIONS :
None .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac catheterization .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
VQ scan , lower extremities noninvasive Doppler studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. State is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .
In the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .
Upon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State &apos;s saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .
Chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .
The patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in May , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .
In addition , Mr. State has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .
His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .
The patient lives on Quelene with his wife .
He is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
Blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .
Mr. State was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .
Jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .
There was no thyromegaly .
Carotids were 2+ .
Breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .
Abdomen :
soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .
There was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .
The urinalysis was negative .
The Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .
Chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State &apos;s filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .
The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Imdur 120 mg. PO q.d. Captopril 100mg. PO t.i.d. Lasix 80 mg. PO q.d. Potassium chloride 40 mEq. PO q.d. Coreg 12.5 mg. b.i.d. Cozaar 100 mg. b.i.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 300 mg. q.d.

Atrial fibrillation .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Intermittent atrial fibrillation .
2. Hepatocellular carcinoma .
3. Diabetes .
4. Valvular heart disease .
5. Congestive heart failure .
6. Thrombocytopenia .
7. Hypertension .
8. Anemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an unfortunate **AGE[in 70s]- year - old white male with past medical history of cirrhosis , hepatocellular CA , coronary artery disease , atrial fibrillation , chronic renal insufficiency , thrombocytopenia , anemia , aortic stenosis , and peptic ulcer disease who had one of many recurrent admissions to **INSTITUTION secondary to multiple falls .
He also is having intermittent confusion .
He was found to be in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was admitted for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] has had multiple hospitalizations recently secondary to his multiple complex medical problems .
He has been recommended to have placement on multiple occasions and that the family has not wanted to do so .
He has intermittent episodes of confusion at home and has had recurrent falls .
He was admitted at this time with atrial flutter .
He was unable to be anticoagulated secondary to thrombocytopenia and high bleeding risk secondary to his gastric varices , which he has had multiple banding procedures done .
He was seen in consultation with cardiology and initially was continued on metoprolol and Cardizem was added .
He has some significant bradycardia with this and so the beta blocker was discontinued and his rate fluctuated between 60 and 90 on Cardizem 120 a day .
He was felt that he did not require pacemaker and was a candidate for a pacemaker secondary to his significant medical problems .
He also was seen by Dr. **NAME[VVV] , the patient 's regular gastroenterologist .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] 's recent MRI s show reoccurrence of the previous ablated area of his hepatocellular CA .
He had evidence of macrovascular involvement in terms of invasion of his portal vein , which make him not a candidate for the potential of a transplant .
In addition , the patient has pretty severe valvular heart disease and is not a candidate for a valve replacement surgery secondary to his liver cancer .
He also has diabetes , which is intermittently controlled and when he goes home he does not check his sugars .
His wife sometimes also gives his medications including Xanax and other medications , which causes him intermittent episodes of delirium .
While in the hospital , the patient was stabilized .
Atrial flutter issues are discussed as above .
His sugars were well controlled and his glipizide was titrated up to 10 mg b.i.d.
Additionally , his lower extremity edema was fairly well controlled and TED hose were added on the day of discharge .
[_______________]*** episodes of bleeding .
His blood count on the day of discharge was stable with hemoglobin of 10.2 , which is near his baseline .
He has chronically low WBC count and his white blood cell count was 3 on discharge and platelets were 45 , which is near his baseline .
His creatinine was 1.7 .
He does have baseline renal insufficiency .
His creatinine was high as 2.4 during his hospitalization , but had stabilized .
After multiple discussions with the family , it was again recommended that he would be placed for at least short term secondary to risk of falls and his overall deconditioning .
The family was in agreement at this time for pacemaker at the **INSTITUTION .
His code status was adjusted during his hospitalization , where he is for chemical code basically only secondary to the poor prognosis of his diseased state .
He certainly is at very high risk for variceal bleed .
It was most likely will be his biggest problem , but is currently has no evidence of any active bleeding .
He has a very significant fall risk and so therefore anticoagulation is not a consideration especially with his low platelet count .
He is to receive physical therapy and occupational therapy with his long - term placement , issues are not currently decided .
He needs to be monitored closely for episodes of CHF and to wear TED hose at all times secondary to his chronic lower extremity edema .
Additionally , he was on potassium supplementation .
His potassium ranged from 5.3 to 3.6 during his hospitalization and stated he should have BMP monitored routinely .
He is not being discharged on any potassium medications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
His medications on discharge are
1. Vicodin 500/5 1 q.6 h. p.r.n. on use of this medication the patient gets delirious with it .
He has had large left flank hematoma , for which he was using it , but that has been significantly decreased .
2. Additionally Celexa 20 mg a day .
3. Cardizem CD 120 mg a day .
4. Ferrous sulfate 325 daily .
5. Lasix 80 mg tablet daily .
6. Glipizide 10 mg b.i.d.
7. Sliding scale insulin .
8. Protonix 40 mg b.i.d.
9. Xifaxan 200 mg t.i.d.
10. Spironolactone 50 mg b.i.d.
11. Carafate 1 g tablet by mouth a.c. and nightly .
He is to wear TED hose at all time .
He has an occasional urinary retention and can have postvoid residual or straight catheterization p.r.n.
He will be discharged in 2 L of O2 .
Again he should have BMP and CBC on **DATE[Oct 18 2007] in a weekly basis .
He should have followup with Dr. **NAME[VVV] , his gastroenterologist in **DATE[Nov 2007] and Dr. **NAME[UUU] , his cardiologist in **DATE[Nov 2007] .
His code status is as above .
I spent an hour in terms of family discussion , discharge planning , and coordination of care for this patient for discharge to nursing home .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Congestive heart failure :
Patient was diuresed effectively with nesiritide and Lasix .
Patient 's weight on admission was 250 pounds , and on the day of discharge was 244 pounds which was back to her dry weight .
She had lost the 6 pounds that she reported gaining in the four days prior to her hospitalization .
Patient was continued on her Toprol , her lisinopril , and her digoxin .
Patient 's Coumadin was held for right heart catheterization and biopsy , and then EP study with ICD placement .
Patient did have Woodrow Betty , SPEP , and anticardiolipin antibody sent for further workup of the etiology of her cardiomyopathy .
The Courtney , SPEP , and anticardiolipin antibody were all negative .
Her CKs did trend down over the course of her hospital stay , and in the setting of her known clean coronaries on cardiac catheterization in 2011-11-19 , it was believed that a myocarditis might be the cause of her elevated cardiac enzymes and also could have exacerbated her congestive heart failure .
Patient did receive a right heart catheterization , which showed elevated wedge pressures and biopsy specimens were obtained of the right ventricle .
The results of these biopsies are still pending in pathology .
Post right heart catheterization and right ventricular biopsy , the patient was sent to the CCU for a Swan - guided therapy in the setting of her elevated wedge pressures and low cardiac output .
In the CCU , she was put on milrinone with good results .
Patient was also seen by the Pulmonary service here and had pulmonary function tests done as part of a pretransplant workup .
There is no pulmonary process to exclude her from the transplant list as noted by the Pulmonary service .

2. Her right lower lobe infiltrate :
Patient did report a cough productive of green sputum on admission .
She received a full course of azithromycin for this with resolution of her cough and sputum production .
On discharge , the patient was restarted on her Coumadin , which was held for her right heart catheterization , and her biopsy , and her ICD placement .
She was also continued on all her heart failure medications including her Toprol , her lisinopril , her digoxin , and her Lasix .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old female with a history of MI in **DATE[Dec 2006] who presented to the emergency department yesterday with complaints of left shoulder and neck pain .
She had a small area of left - sided chest pain .
The patient reported that the pain began the day prior to admission following a verbal argument with her grandson .
She denies any trauma .
She did note some shortness of breath initially which subsequently resolved .
However , her shoulder , neck , and left - sided chest pain did persist .
As the symptoms were similar to the symptoms she experienced when she had her MI , she was concerned and decided to come to the emergency department .
She did have a negative troponin at presentation but was admitted to rule out MI .
The patient 's hospital course was essentially unremarkable .
She had recently undergone a heart catheterization in **DATE[Dec 2006] which showed vasospasm .
Additionally , she has had a TTE back in **DATE[Jan 2007] which showed an ejection fraction of 55% and an adenosine stress test in **DATE[Feb 2007] which showed a resting perfusion abnormality at the apex and inferior wall and septum consistent with an old infarct in the mid LAD .
In the hospital on this admission , the patient had a second troponin which was negative .
She tolerated a regular diet and was up and out of bed .
Based on the patient 's exam and her normal troponins , we were confident that her symptoms were much more likely to be related to a musculoskeletal type injury rather than something cardiac .
She did have a shoulder x-ray which was negative .
She will be discharged to home and will follow up with her PCP .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
To home .
FOLLOWUP :
Followup in 1 weeks with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] at 94 **INSTITUTION .

86 yo man with h/o CVA , CHF , recent episodes of aspiration pneumonia , who p/w dyspnea from his NH .
Per the pt 's daughter , the patient has had 2-3 episodes of asp pna in the last 2 months , for which he has received IV abx at the NH with apparent resolution of symptoms .
The daughter says that on the day PTA , when she visited the patient at the NH , he was " having a good day ," more interactive than usual and in good spirits .
She was called at 430 am today from the NH with the news that the pt was not doing well , and she came to the Deanna to meet up with her father .
Of note , the patient 's daughter and son-in-law confirm his desire to be DNR/DNI , stating that they want him to be comfortable .
However , when asked if she thinks he would want comfort measures even if it meant that his respiratory status would worsen , the pt 's daughter says that he would not .
In particular , she feels that the pt would not want a morphine drip if it would negatively impact his respiratory function .

CXR :
IMPRESSION :
Focal consolidation in the medial aspect of the right lower lung
Brief Hospital Course :
This 86 yo man with h/o CVA , CHF , recent episodes of aspiration pneumonia , presented with dyspnea from his NH , likely from new RLL pneumonia .
He was started on Zosyn and Vanco for his presumed aspiration , " hospital " aquired PNA .
PE was considered but less likely given his fevers and clear pneumonia on CXR .
He was supported on BIPAP for his respiratory status .
An ABG was attempted in the Deanna however it was limited by pt discomfort .
ABG on arrival to the ICU was 7.29/56/75 .
He was continued on BIPAP .
Blood cultures and sputum cultures were sent .
Over the course of the day he continued to decline .
He was given some prn Morphine for comfort .
In the evening of the day of admission he was noted to be increasingly somnolent .
A repeat ABG was performed which was 7.03/129/148 .
His family was notified that he was doing worse and came in to visit him .
It was his family 's wish that he be made comfortable .
Based upon this wish the BIPAP was removed and he was placed on nasal cannula .
He was written for a morphine drip however he expired before this could be initiated .
Secondary issues
Elevated lactate :
This was concerning for early sepsis given RLL PNA .
His blood pressures remained elevated and he was hydrated with NS conservatively , given h/o CHF and dyspnea .
DM2 :
He was covered with a Insulin drip while unstable
CV :
CAD :
He was not taking any PO medications per Hunt Center Rehab so all medications were held .

Discharge Date :
12/07/1997
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 50 year-old female with a history of bilateral lung nodules dating back to the July of 1995 discovered on a work-up for an adrenal abnormality .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 64-year-old female with a history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , and dilated cardiomyopathy ( with a transthoracic echocardiogram in 2016-01-13 showing an ejection fraction of 40% , posterior and inferior apical akinesis , and large left ventricular thrombus ).
The patient was admitted from 2016-01-21 to 2016-02-03 ; at which time she was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
She had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease with normal left main , mid left anterior descending artery 60% , diffuse 90% mid distal stenosis at the origin of the diagonal , serial 70% and 90% left circumflex lesions , and 90% first obtuse marginal , and mid right coronary artery 60% .
During initial evaluation for a coronary artery bypass graft , 80% to 90% of the right coronary artery stenosis was found ; for which she underwent a right internal carotid artery stent .
She was discharged on Coumadin for a goal INR of 2.5 to 3 .
She was then admitted again on 2016-03-30 for an elective coronary artery bypass graft .
At surgery , the descending aorta was noted to be calcified , and an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an irregular intra-aortic pedunculated lesion .
Given the elevated stroke risk of aortic cross-clamping in the setting of this finding , the plan for a bypass graft was aborted .
The patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit Service for medical management in anticipation of possible percutaneous coronary intervention later in the admission .

Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly .
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm .
Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds .
No audible murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended with active bowel sounds .
Extremities were without edema .
Neurologic examination was nonfocal .
Lines included a right antecubital peripheral intravenous .
Chest tube was in place in left internal jugular an pulmonary artery catheter .
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION :
Laboratories revealed white blood cell count was 12.7 , hematocrit was 32.4 , platelets were 140 , and mean cell volume was 80 .
Patient was 4.4 , blood urea nitrogen was 14 , creatinine was 0.6 , and glucose was 147 .
INR was 1.2 , partial thromboplastin time was 23.7 , and prothrombin time was 13.4 .
Free calcium was 0.95 on 03-30 .
Phosphate was 3.6 and magnesium was 2.2 .
Arterial blood gas at 3 a.m. demonstrated 7.4/45/125 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 64-year-old female with 3-vessel disease who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit Service for Western Mass .
Hospital medical optimization and management following an aborted coronary artery bypass graft when a mobile aortic atheroma was noted .
The patient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , and statin .
Once the patient was titrated off dopamine , the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were restarted .
With regard to the left ventricular thrombus , her goal INR remained 2.5 to 3 ; and the goal was to start heparin once the patient was stable from a thoracotomy and chest tube
standpoint .
The patient remained comfortable .
By 04-01 , on postoperative day two , the patient was doing well and the chest tube was discontinued .
The patient still had transcutaneous pacing wires in place .
Likewise , on 04-01 , the patient was weaned off surgery without difficulty .
Thus , the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were started to be titrated up .
In addition , the patient was started on Wellbutrin for smoking cessation .
At this point , it was determined that the patient would not receive percutaneous coronary intervention on this admission and would likely be discharged to the floor for stabilization with followup .
The patient did well and was transferred to the floor on 04-02 .
After evaluation and a discussion with Dr. Gunter , it was determined that the patient no longer needed anticoagulation since there was no aortic thrombus but only an aortic plaque , and there was no anterior/apical akinesis noted .
At this point , the left ventricular thrombus ( for which she was initially started therapy for ) was no longer present .
The patient was noted to have a slight hematocrit drop and was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for a goal hematocrit of greater than 30 .
By 04-03 , captopril and atenolol were started , and the patient 's leg bandage from the vein harvest was removed .
The patient continued to do well on the medical regimen and was without chest pain , shortness of breath , or any other symptoms .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
Thus , the patient was discharged to home .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP :
The patient was to follow up with her primary care physician ( Dr. Desmet ) , as well as
with Dr. Gunter for an eventual percutaneous coronary intervention , and her surgeon ( Dr. Halcomb ) following her thoracotomy .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease ; 3-vessel disease .
2. Status post aborted coronary artery bypass graft due to mobile aortic atheroma .
3. Diabetes .
4. Hypertension .
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :
Condition on discharge was stable and asymptomatic .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day .
2. Docusate 100 mg p.o. twice per day .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Right thyroid papillary carcinoma .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Pulmonary and right iliac bone metastases .
2. Eosinophilia .
3. Chronic leg edema .
4. Atrial fibrillation .
5. Congestive heart failure .
6. Left subclavian vein thrombosis .
7. Urinary tract infection .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on 4/28/93 with progressive weakness , weight loss and shortness of breath .
The patient was in a good state of health until January of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue .
She had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months .
Although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving , her weakness persisted .
A work up begun by her internist , Dr. Brain , revealed a white blood cell count of 49,000 with 50% eosinophils .
She was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home for further evaluation .
Data collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable .
The liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303 , LDH 310 , SGOT 66 , albumin 2.5 .
A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers .
Chromosomal studies were negative .
A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area .
A thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass .
This was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst .
Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid .
An upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable .
The small bowel follow through was within normal limits .
A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side .
A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly .
The patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain .
She continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss .
She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion .
A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .
The patient reports no history of radiation exposure , no family history of thyroid carcinoma , no recent travels or exposure to tuberculosis .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes a history of atrial fibrillation with good heart rate control on Digoxin .
She reports no prior surgical history .
The patient also reports no known drug allergy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone in Leschle Drive , Sonpo , and does not report a smoking or alcohol history .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Lanoxin , 0.25 mg po qd ; Lasix , 20 mg po qd .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant , elderly female in no acute distress .
Her vital signs showed a blood pressure of 126/72 , pulse 84 , respirations 22 , temperature 98.6 .
She had a 3 x 4 cm firm , nontender right thyroid mass that seemed to be fixed to the trachea .
She had no jugular venous distention or bruits .
The lungs exhibited right basilar dullness one quarter of the way up .
She had no definite S3 .
The liver edge was palpable to 6 cm below the right costal margin .
Her spleen could not be palpated .
She had 4+ edema to the knees bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the white blood count was 67.3 with a differential of 21% polys , 16% bands , 3% lymphocytes , 2% monocytes , 57% eosinophils and 1% myelocytes .
Her hematocrit was 38.8 , hemoglobin 13.7 , platelet count 155,000 , PT 12.7/10.1 , PTT 33.9 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 , calcium 7.5 , phosphorus 3.5 , sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 15 , total protein 5.9 , albumin 2.3 , globulin 3.6 , alkaline phosphatase 379 , SGOT 37 , Digoxin level 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .
Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .
Accordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .
This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .
A lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .
During this time the patient &apos;s coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing .
ANCA serum results were negative .
ANA results were also nonsuggestive .
The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .
There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .
A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .
Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .
Meanwhile , the patient &apos;s eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .
She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .
The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .
Dr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .
On 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .
She underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .
She was received in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .
Her rate was well controlled on Digoxin .
The patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .
On the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy .
Calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .
She continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .
She continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .
Anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin .
She was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .
She also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .
She did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Coumadin , 5 mg po alternating with 2.5 mg po ; prednisolone , 30 mg po bid ; hydrochlorothiazide , 50 mg po bid ; potassium chloride , 40 mEq po bid ; Augmentin , 500 mg po tid ; Digoxin , 0.125 mg po qd ; Tylenol , 650 mg po q4h prn ; Carafate , 1 gram po bid ; Synthroid , 0.125 mg po qd .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged home with Terchestlumnesamp Medical Center referral for weekly blood tests , potassium and PT .
The patient is also to keep her left arm elevated and to remain on a low sodium diet .
She will be maintained on a PT between 15 and 17 with Coumadin .
Arrangements will be made for radiation therapy to the right neck and right iliac crest .
The prognosis for rehabilitation potential is guarded .

Briefly , this is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old gentleman who had undergone previous lumbar laminectomy by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Aug 18]th .
He had done quite well , however , presented to the office last week with some superficial redness of his wound and a minimal amount of serous drainage .
The patient was given prophylactic antibiotics for this and sent home , at which time he stated over the weekend he had a drop of what he felt was pus on his dressing and was subsequently readmitted in the hospital for reevaluation of possible superficial wound infection .
He was subsequently admitted and due to poor IV access required placement of PICC line and started on both Cipro as well as vancomycin prophylactic antibiotics for suspected superficial wound infection .
He underwent an MRI , which showed a small collection in the wound , and he was scheduled for possible wound debridement .
However , following further evaluation of his wound on **DATE[Aug 29]th , he is noted to have no further redness of his wound and a previous rash has now dissipated .
There is no drainage of his wound , as well , and his staples have been removed .
Throughout this time he has had no fever or chills , and his white count has remained normal at 7.0 .
His sedimentation rate was slightly elevated at 30 .
The patient , per Infectious Disease Service , will be recommended the following antibiotics :
Zyvox 600 mg b.i.d. and Cipro 500 mg b.i.d. for an additional 10 days .
He is also recommended to have weekly CBC and platelet count and instructed to watch for any wound drainage , swelling , or pus , any chills or fever , any other symptoms with increasing pain and to immediately contact the office or go to the local Emergency Room .
The patient is agreeable and he can be discharged home later today following removal of PICC line .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Change in mental status .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 57-year-old nursing home resident female , who had been in her usual state of
health until about three weeks ago when the daughter noted she was sleeping more .
Per record , she has had multiple episodes in the last week of changes in mental status .
EMTs called many times .
The patient would awake prior to arrival and not need transfer .
The patient was seen at the Leonard Morse/Metrowest Medical Center on 09-28 .
No localizing etiology of delta MS .
That evening she was unresponsive and the patient was brought to Amesbury Hospital Hospital .
There her oxygen she was sating 65% on room air , increased to 98% with a nonrebreather mask .
There an ABG was done which showed an ABG of 7.42 , 62 , and 55 .
She had a head CT that was negative .
Chest x-ray that was questionable left lower lobe infiltrate .
Lumbar puncture was performed and the micro cultures are still pending .
She was seen by Psychiatry at the outside hospital , but noted there was no psychoses , but delirium .
The patient 's mental status waxed and waned there .
She also had a K of 6.0 and given 30 of Kayexalate , 5 of Haldol , 2 mg of Ativan given for
agitation , and 2 mg of ceftriaxone was given for a temperature of 101.3 with a concern for meningitis as a LP was done prior .
Patient was transferred to the Kindred Hospital Melendez the patient 's primary care provider was here .
She is currently being seen by Addison Gilbert Hospital Group .
On arrival to Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary , she was unresponsive with an oxygen saturation of 72% on 6 liters .
She was placed on 50% vent mask , which improved her oxygenation to 97% .
Patient was placed on BiPAP .
Original ABG here before BiPAP was 7.19 , 102 , and 92 .
After being placed on BiPAP , her blood pressure decreased to the 80s .
She responded to 1 liter of IV fluids , normal saline and blood pressure remained stable .
Patient had peripheral IV x1 placed and right femoral line placed in the Matthew .
When laying flat , her sats decreased to 50% on 30% FIO2 , PEEP of 10 , and pressure support of 5 .
Her ABG at the time was 7.24 , 91 , and 38 .
Once the patient sat up , her sats improved and her airway was no longer obstructed .
After a history on BiPAP about a half an hour , her ABG was 7.29 , 79 , and 106 on 30% pressure support of 5 and PEEP of 10 .
Patient was intermittently awaking .
She denied any pain and was not answering questions at the time .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure issues :
The patient presented with changes in mental status , pCO2 of 100 , pH of 7.19 , decreasing sats on arrival likely element of obstructive-sleep apnea .
She was monitored overnight .
She had admitted to the CMED and had multiple episodes of apnea throughout the night .
She was placed on pressure support , which improved her saturations and decreased her hypercarbia .
Patient improved that her mental status with improvement of her oxygenation and ventilation as well as for correction of her respiratory acidosis .
Patient was eventually placed on BiPAP on hospital day three , on the date prior to discharge of BiPAP settings of 12/8/5 liters of oxygen with saturations of 96% with a gas of 7.38 , 67 , and 91 with an aim of a goal pCO2 of 67 .
She only had one episode of apnea on the day prior to discharge .
2. Delta MS/mental status issues :
Most likely her waxing and waning mental status and hypercarbia/hypoxia compounded by infection of pneumonia and UTI .
With improvements of her ventilation and oxygenation and treatment with levofloxacin of her UTI and pneumonia , her mental status greatly improved on hospital day two without further waxing and waning .
Her daughters came by and visited her , and reported that she was at her baseline mental status on the day prior to discharge .
B12 , folate , RPR were all sent that were unremarkable as causes for delta MS .
We are awaiting results of the lumbar puncture from the outside hospital , but on hospital day two .
Those cultures are still pending at the time .
Patient was also given multivites .
3. Fever issues :
The patient initially presented with T max of 101.3 at outside hospital with increasing white blood cell counts and a positive urinalysis .
A chest x-ray with bilateral patchy infiltrates likely pneumonia and UTI .
Upon calling the outside hospital , the urine was growing out Klebsiella , and patient was given a 10 day course of levofloxacin to cover both the pneumonia and UTI .
Blood cultures and urine cultures are still pending at this hospital visit and the CSF fluid from Whitter Rehabilitation Hospital needs to be further evaluated .
Patient on the day of discharge was afebrile with a decreasing white count x48 hours .
4. Acute renal failure issues :
Creatinine initially presented at 1.3 .
Patient is known to have a baseline of 1.0 , most likely hypovolemia and prerenal .
A FENa was sent , was 0.3% .
Patient was gently hydrated and IV fluids started up on a p.o. diet regimen .
On hospital day two , her creatinine returned to 0.8 , and she remained with a creatinine of 0.8 for the remainder of her hospital stay .
Patient's K was followed , and trended back down to normal on the day of discharge at 3.9 .
5. Elevated transaminases :
Patient had no right upper quadrant pain .
Stewart sign was negative .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed that showed no hepatic or biliary pathology likely due to acute phase stress changes given the fact that she had no clinical symptoms .
There is no need to followup these transaminases .
6. Congestive heart failure history :
Patient was stable without evidence of CHF on chest x-ray .
Followed her sats likely due to obstructive-sleep apnea and hypoventilation .
Patient was restarted on her beta blocker and .......- receptor blocker on hospital day two given that her creatinine had stabilized .
Patient had no further cardiac issues at this time .
She was on telemetry without any episodes of any rhythm abnormalities .
7. CMED CCU :
The patient had some vaginal bleeding x2 days .
Patient had a history of fibroids during this hospitalization .
Followed her examination .
Her hematocrit remained stable throughout this course .
Patient is strongly encouraged to followup with her outside primary care provider to followup for the vaginal bleeding given her history of fibroids and question metaplasia of the endometrium .
8. Heme :
Her hematocrit remained stable .
She had a history of nucleated RBCs likely secondary to stress and hypoxia during this admission .
Hemolysis laboratories were negative .
Patient was restarted on her iron supplementation .
Reticulocyte count was performed that was negative .
9. FEN :
She was NPO with a decrease in her mental status .
We slowly advanced her diet as her mental status improved and repleted her electrolytes , and started on her p.o. medications on hospital day two .
10. Diabetes :
Patient had q.i.d. fingersticks with a Humalog sliding scale and NPH doses were cut in half while she was NPO , and they were brought back to her normal doses on the day of discharge with a full diet .
11. Code status :
Full .
Two daughters came by and requested to be health care proxies as patient approved .
Documentation is in her medical chart .
12. Prophylaxis :
The patient was on subQ Heparin for DVT and ranitidine for GI prophylaxis .
DISPOSITION:
The patient is to be discharged today to Lahey Clinic - North Shore Hospital for long-term pulmonary ........ therapy and further evaluation of her obstructive-sleep apnea .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Patient was stable with complete clearance of her mental status , advancement of her diet ,
blood pressure , and heart rate remained stable , and her oxygen saturations were well above 90% during the daytime on 2 liters nasal cannula and at night on the BiPAP settings
described above .
Physical Therapy consult is pending today .

REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female who was seen in the office because of shortness of breath .
She was unable to go from room to room .
This has been progressive over the past month but no chest pain .
She also had a severe cough with scanty sputum production .
She is an ex - smoker .
Only other history is abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
The patient has been on albuterol , Fosamax , aspirin , Cardizem , Zetia , and Zocor at home .
On arrival , chest x-ray showed a new left pleural effusion since that of **DATE[Mar 22 2007] , with an inflammatory versus neoplastic disease to be considered .
She was , therefore , admitted with a lung lesion to rule out carcinoma and for pulmonary evaluation .
LABORATORY DATA :
Initial sodium 138 , potassium 3.6 .
BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.0 .
Troponin 0.06 .
Glucose 120 .
Hemoglobin and hematocrit 9.8 and 29.3 and white count 14,000 .
BNP is 15 .
Troponin levels were negative .
At discharge , at one point , potassium was 3.3 , which was repleted .
Bronchial washings :
No Legionella was isolated .
Echocardiogram :
Concentric LVH with an ejection fraction of 60% , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , and mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension .
Cardiogram :
Sinus tachycardia .
As outlined above , the patient was admitted because of an abnormal chest x-ray suspicious for carcinoma of the lung .
Dr. **NAME[VVV] was asked to see the patient .
He read chest x-ray showing right pleural effusion and possibility of a developing neoplasm .
He did recommend bronchodilators .
O2 saturations were followed , and he also recommended an immediate bronchoscopy , as CAT scan showed a large left lower lobe 9 x 5.5 cm mass with decreased attenuation and infiltrate adjacent to the mass .
There were pulmonary nodules varying from 1 to 5 cm and extensive mediastinal left hilar enlarged subcarinal adenopathy .
Bronchoscopy was performed .
The left lower lobe bronchus showed some narrowing .
The preliminary cytology was that of a nonsmall - cell lung carcinoma .
For this reason , Dr. **NAME[UUU] was asked to see the patient from oncology standpoint , and he felt that the patient had at least stage III lung cancer and agreed it could be nonsmall cell .
The patient and husband were informed that this was not an operative situation and that palliative treatment was the best option either in the form of chemotherapy or radiation therapy .
He did recommend an outpatient PET scan for staging and to follow within 10 to 14 days at his office .
During this admission , the patient also developed a rectal bleed and was seen by Dr. **NAME[TTT] who recommended a colonoscopy .
When electrolytes were corrected , colonoscopy was carried out on **DATE[Nov 17 2007] , showing a long loopy colon with hemorrhoids .
He recommended Anusol suppositories along with Citracal .
Potassium had been low and was corrected .
To complete with workup , an echocardiogram had also been done because of left pleural effusion .
Results are as above .
From standpoint of lung carcinoma , final pathology was that of a nonsmall - cell carcinoma .
Arrangements were made for the patient to have a PET scan as an outpatient and continued followup with Dr. **NAME[UUU] .
She was free of chest pains and shortness of breath at this time .
She will follow a regular diet .
No heavy lifting over 10 pounds .
Her PCP , Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] , will see her within 2 weeks , Dr. **NAME[VVV] as directed , and Dr. **NAME[UUU] within 10 to 14 days .
Electrolytes , BUN , and creatinine will be done on **DATE[Nov 25 2007] .
Home care nurses will also follow as needed .
At this time , the patient is free of symptoms , but will report any fever over 101 or hemoptysis or increase in sputum production .

On hospital day number three , her blood cultures came back positive in the anaerobic culture for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters .
Further identification revealed staphylococcus coag-negative , which was sensitive to gentamicin and clindamycin .
She was continued on her antibiotics , and was afebrile until hospital day number five , when she had a temperature spike to 102.3 .
Repeat blood cultures were sent .
Her white blood cell count was 12.8 , with a normal differential .
At this time , an Infectious Disease consult was obtained , and the recommendation was to discontinue the ampicillin , gentamicin and clindamycin , and start her on intravenous Unasyn .
She underwent a pelvic ultrasound and an abdomen and pelvis CT , which revealed continued air in the endometrial cavity vs. in the fundal fibroid .
Discussion was had at this time with the patient regarding whether or not this represented an infected abscess vs. post-surgical change .
Extensive discussion was held , and second opinion was obtained regarding the need for
possible drainage of the abscess vs. hysterectomy .
The patient requested an outside second opinion , as she was reluctant to undergo hysterectomy at this time .
She was discharged to home on hospital day number eight , on oral antibiotics .
The patient was to have a repeat CT scan in one week .
She was also to obtain a second opinion regarding the question of possible surgical management .

4-3-93 
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : 
Post-infarction unstable angina pectoris . 
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : 
Inferior wall myocardial infarction , ventricular fibrillation arrest , congestive heart failure , paroxysmal atrial tachycardia , coronary artery disease , psychosis . 
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS : 
3-27-93 , cardiac catheterization and coronary and left ventricular angiography ; 4-2-93 , exercise tolerance test with Thallium . 
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE : 
Vasotec 5 mg PO b.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg PO q.i.d. , Ticlopidine 50 mg PO b.i.d. , Metoprolol 50 mg PO b.i.d. , Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO q12h x seven days , nitroglycerin 0.3 mg sublingually prn chest pain . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
The patient is a 73 year old female who was transferred for cardiac catheterization after ventricular fibrillation arrest in the setting of an acute inferior myocardial infarction and a urinary tract infection . 
The patient was admitted on 3-16-93 to Diy Hospital for an E. coli urinary tract infection . 
The patient was readmitted on 3-20-93 because of fever , chills and a sudden onset of ventricular fibrillation arrest , successfully cardioverted back to rapid atrial fibrillation and finally to sinus rhythm , where an electrocardiogram then showed ST elevation in inferior leads . 
Peak CPK was 2494 with 18% MB 's . 
She required intubation for mild to moderate congestive heart failure , treated with diuretics , intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin . 
She had post-infarction angina , was transferred here for angiography and possible percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : 
On physical examination , blood pressure is 130/80 , pulse 74 and regular , respirations 14 . 
Her chest demonstrated bibasilar crackles . 
Cardiovascular exam : 
the jugular venous pressure was seven centimeters , carotid upstroke normal . 
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 was normally split . 
There was an S4 , no S3 , grade II/VI apical murmur in systole , no rubs . 
The abdomen was benign , unremarkable . 
Extremities : 
no calf tenderness or peripheral edema . 
Peripheral pulses were 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : 
On 3-27-93 , patient underwent cardiac catheterization , coronary and left ventricular angiography without complications . 
Review of these angiograms demonstrated a dominant right coronary artery with a focal 50% stenosis in the mid-portion . 
The left main coronary artery was clear . 
The left anterior descending had moderate plaques with a 50% proximal stenosis of the right anterior oblique caudal view . 
The proximal diagonal D1 had a 50% stenosis . 
The circumflex had a long 30% stenosis proximally and an 80% stenosis at the origin of the second major marginal artery . 
The left ventricular angiogram showed akinesis of the posterobasal walls , severe hypokinesis of the diaphragmatic wall and trace mitral regurgitation . 
The patient was maintained on heparin anticoagulation . 
An exercise tolerance test with Thallium was to be performed in order to assess myocardial viability in the infarct zone . 
The right coronary artery lesion was complex and there was severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal 1 . 
The patient had no further angina . 
On 4-2-93 , she underwent a Persantine Thallium study . 
This showed no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes for ischemia and no angina pectoris . 
The thallium images showed a large region of persistently reduced blood flow involving the apex and inferoposterior segments of the left ventricular wall . 
This was consistent with scar . 
There was no definite perfusion abnormality in the circumflex zone . 
In view of these findings , it was elected to discharge her on her present medical program . 
The patient is to return to the follow up care of Dr. Ko Kollciem at the Diy Hospital .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS( ES ) :
1. SPLENIAL MASS .
2. SMALL HEMORRHAGE AT #1 .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This patient as brought in to **INSTITUTION after his daughter noticing some confusion while driving .
He had a CT performed which once again reveal evidence of a splenial mass .
The patient had been following with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] for approximately two years and the lesion at baseline had been unchanged .
During that time frame while there was some questions whether it was secondary the cuts of the MRI s .
CT scan from the 29th , however , once again revealed the corpus callosum lesion with hyperdensity .
There is no definite hemorrhage .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was brought in .
The arteriogram revealed no evidence of internal or extracranial abnormalities .
It was essentially an unremarkable study .
There was no evidence of AVM or AV fistula .
His MRI from the 29th once again was consistent with a hemorrhage within the splenium of the corpus callosum extending to the pineal region .
As a result of these findings , the various options were discussed with the patient and Dr. **NAME[SSS] was consulted in regard to possible stereotactic biopsy for treatment .
The various options as stated earlier were discussed with the patient and it was agreed upon by the family members and the patient to be brought back for stereotactic biopsy .
The patient had a repeat MRI prior to his discharge and was deemed he will be discharged into follow-up with Dr. **NAME[SSS] in approximately four weeks .

NON-Q WAVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
10-24-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
11-2-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Status post anterior myocardial infarction in 05-93 , status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in 05-93 , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Coronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Metoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .
He was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q&apos;s in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.
On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .
The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .
He had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA &apos;d to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB&apos;s .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .
He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .
On day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .
On day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .
Therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .
The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .
However , he did not keep any of these appointments .
He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .
On the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .
He was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
His past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .
HABITS :
The patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .
The HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .
The pupils equal , round , reactive to light .
The oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .
There were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .
The neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .
The carotids were 1+ without bruits .
The heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
The lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .
The abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .
The liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .
There was no splenomegaly .
The femoral pulses were diminished .
He had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .
The extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The pulses were 1+ bilaterally .
The skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .
The rectal examination was guaiac negative .
LABORATORY DATA :
The laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .
The portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .
The electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .
He was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .
No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .
This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA &apos;d , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .
The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .
Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .
He was ambulated progressively on the floor .
A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .
The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .
On 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .
This treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .
The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .
There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .
The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .
Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .
There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .
These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .
After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .
The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .
Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient &apos;s daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient &apos;s compliance .
Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .
The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .
She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .
The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .
Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .
He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Feb 12 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Feb 30 07]
I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who is status post sternectomy for sternal wound infection .
Her hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure , fluid overload , and hyperglycemia .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed her laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the critical care house staff .
Problems and the management are as follows :
1. Respiratory Failure :
A chest x-ray shows an increase in the bilateral effusions .
On the vent , I have her on assist control .
Today I have switched her from AC to pressure support and after a couple of hours of pressure support of 10 , she is a little dyspneic , her heart rate is up , and she has some retractions .
I suspect that her altered sternal mechanics , debilitation , and fluid overload are rate limiting factors for weaning at this point .
I have placed her back on high level pressure support .
Respiratory rate has come down to the range of 12 to 14 .
Tidal volumes are back up and her retractions have resolved .
2. Sternal Wound Infection :
She is going to the operating room tomorrow .
In the meanwhile , I have empirically on cefepime and vancomycin .
Her vancomycin trough is 37 today and I have held her dose with a plan to recheck tomorrow .
3. ICU Prophylaxis :
She is being tube fed at her goal rate .
I have her on a bowel regime .
I have discontinued her IV fluid .
I have her on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control .
The total critical care time equals 40 minutes .

Brief Hospital Course :
Assessment and Plan :
This is a 79 y/o M with h/o HTN , DM , recent CVA , chronic ventilatory failure , CRI on HD who presents with change in MS and febrile in the Amanda , admitted to CMED .
# Altered mental status : Ct scan with no evidence of new intracraneal bleeding .
Patient febrile in the Amanda .
High WBC .
It was thought that it could have been a combination of hypotension , hypercapnia and infection .
He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics .
Despite having a profund limitation communicating given his neurological status , his mental changes seemed to improved initially .
However later on during his course , his mental status deteriorated , being even less responsive .
# ID :
Patient febrile and with a high WBC on admission .
After starting broad spectrum antibiotics - cefepime - vancomycin and flagyl ( for initial concern of aspiration pneumonia ), he responded clinically .
Urine cx from Rehab showed gram negative rods > 100 K enterobacter cloacae .
Urine Cx in house grew Citrobacter Freundi and his sputum grew Acinetobacter Baummani .
Since there was no more evidence of gram positive infections , vancomycin was discontinued and cefepime was kept .
# Fevers : in the Amanda , high WBC , possible pneumonia .
Also possible source sinus infections given findings on intial CT ( see summary in significant studies ). He did not spike any fevers after being transfer to the CMED from the Amanda .
# Resp : Patient was intermitentely switched from AC to Pressure support trials .
However , after Patient did well .
Then trach mask trials were done .
He tolerated this well , although he required PS overnight .
# ESRD on hemodyalisis : Renal service was consulted and HD was continued .
# CV :
Rhythm : NSR , not tachycardic .
Pump : With trace of lower extremity edema .
X ray suggested some pulmonary edema on admission .
Despite this findings , he was supported with 40% FIO2 most of the time .
CAD : On admission Ck low normal , MB not done .
Troponin 0.44. 
It was more likely due to CRI .
Second set 12 hours apart , showed no changes .
s/p stroke : continue aspirin , statin , plavix
# Hypotension : per referral form .
Intially concern for sepsis in the setting of fevers and high blood count .
His BP medications were held on admission .
Patient did not require pressors .
His blood pressure remained stable and BP meds were restarted .
# FEN :
Tube feedings were started thorugh peg tube .
On 2013-09-08 , patient pulled out peg tube .
Temporary foley was placed and on 2013-09-11 ,
On 2013-09-12 after deterioration of his mental status and also of his blood pressure , goals of care were discussed with his HCP .
It was decided to direct goals of care towards confort care .
Patient passed away accompanied by his significant other .

IDENTIFICATION :
Ms. Less was initially admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service for Dr. Scosthuang and was recently transferred to the Neurosurgery Service under the care of Dr. Pae .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Less is a 79 year old white female with history of non small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 02/95 .
She underwent a resection for stage I in 10/95 and treated with XRT .
She presented to the hospital with a numb right leg this morning and underwent an emergent embolectomy .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in 1990 , peptic ulcer disease and hypertension .
MEDICATIONS :
Medications on admission were Coumadin , Digoxin Synthroid , Lopressor and Zantac .
On 1/14/96 , she had a dialysis catheter .
On 1/18/96 , she had an acute change in mental status and underwent an emergent head CT scan which showed a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage with bleeding in the subarachnoid space , and throughout the ventricles .
She also had significant hydrocephalus .
Follow up CT scan showed worsening of her hydrocephalus and she had a ventriculostomy placed in the Intensive Care Unit .
She failed to improve following placement of the ventriculostomy and her poor prognosis was discussed with the family .

I am managing this critically - ill , **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female , who is status post external debridement for a sternitis post CABG , hospital course now complicated by fluid overload and respiratory failure .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed her laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the critical care house staff .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. MEDIASTINITIS .
Her vancomycin trough level today is 23 .
I have repeated the dose of vancomycin and will watch the levels closely for the next couple of days .
I have left her on her cefepime ; current dose is 2 grams q. 12 hours .
White blood cell count is up to 23,000 today .
Platelets are up to 93,000 .
She is going to the operating room tomorrow for another debridement .
2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE .
Chest x-ray shows some decrease in the bilateral effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion .
I have rested her overnight on a pressure support of 20 .
She has been comfortable with this , with tidal volumes of around 500 to 700 and a respiratory rate of around 9 to 12 .
Today , we have done a brief partial support trial at 5 , and she became tachypneic with a high rapid shallow breathing index .
I have rested her back on full support .
I suppose that she will need longer term mechanical ventilatory support until her pulmonary mechanics have improved .
3. ICU PROPHYLAXIS .
I have KVOd her IV fluid , increased her tube feeds to 45 mL an hour , and increased her beta blockade in light of her ischemic heart disease .
The total critical care time equals 40 minutes .

2. Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction .
3. Renal artery stenosis , status post stenting .
4. Mitral regurgitation 4 + .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :

3. Cardiomyopathy .
4. Congestive heart failure .
5. Hypertension .
6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease .
7. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
8. Degenerative joint disease .
Significant procedures done for the patient while on admission are as follows :
1. Echocardiogram on **DATE[May 2 2007] , which showed moderate LV dysfunction with segmental abnormalities .
a. Normal left ventricular chamber size .
b. Aortic valve sclerosis .
c. Moderate mitral valve insufficiency .
d. Mild tricuspid insufficiency .
e. Moderate pulmonary hypertension .
2. Cardiac catheterization **DATE[Dec 5 2007] , during which she has left heart catheterization for coronary angiography , left ventriculogram , renal arteriogram , and right heart catheterization .
The findings are as follows :
a. Severe three-vessel coronary artery disease .
b. Patent LIMA graft to the LAD .
c. Saphenous vein graft distal to the right coronary artery .
d. Occluded saphenous vein graft to the probable obtuse marginal branch .
e. Severe mitral regurgitation .

g. Pulmonary hypertension which is likely due to mitral valve disease .
h. MR 4 +. i .
Left renal artery stenosis 90% .
3. Left renal artery stent by Interventional Radiology .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year-old lady with past medical history listed below who was admitted with DKA secondary to non - Q - wave MI .
Apparently , the patient checked blood glucose at home which showed critical high , after which she presented to the emergency room .
Was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis and dehydrated .
She was then admitted to the ICU for malignant of DKA .
However , her troponin level was noted to have increased from 1.89 to 5.19 with increase in CPK from 160 to 240 and CPK-MB from 5.7 to
12.6 .
The patient was rehydrated and medically managed in the ICU , after which she underwent cardiac catheterization with the above report .
Throughout the episodes of illness , the patient denied any chest pain .
She had mild shortness of breath and generalized weakness .
The patient 's condition improved very well during the admission .
During the cardiac catheterization , she was noted to have left renal artery stenosis up to 90% for which she had cardiac catheterization as described above .
A recommendation was made for her to have her mitral valve regurgitation repair ; however , the patient declined the procedure stating that her mother had mitral valve regurgitation and she lived for many years without having any problem .
The patient also had a carotid Doppler done which showed 0 to 39% on both sides .
The patient was managed on the following issues during admission and discharge :
1. DKA .
The patient 's diabetic ketoacidosis was secondary to the non - Q - wave MI as mentioned above .
She was initially managed on insulin infusion .
Later on , switched to insulin sliding scale .
She is going to be discharged home on home medication which is Humulin 70/30 insulin , 40 units , a.c. before breakfast and then 28 units a.c. before dinner .
She will continue to check her insulin glucose at home .
2. Coronary artery disease .
The patient has had CABG in the past , that was about 6 to 7 years ago .
She has graft ( _______________ ) native vessels occluded OM circumflex done .
Estimated EF is 25% .
There are no symptoms of pulmonary hypertension .
No edema or CHF .
At the moment , she is in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy .
a. She has high risk for OHS due to comorbidities .
b. If she agrees to surgery , we need to do surgery with antiplatelets on board which will lead to more transfusion .
c. She will benefit from dual - chamber biventricular ICD regardless of whether she has the OHS or not .
d. Her left ventricle is dilated and weak .
Even when the mitral regurgitation is fixed , this will lead to increase afterload to the left ventricle .
This will place more strain on the already weak heart ; so , the recommendations are we change the metoprolol to Coreg 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
We will avoid aldosterone antagonist as this will likely affect her potassium which is already on the high side .
There is a question of if left circumflex system could be revascularized if she happens to go to the OR for the mitral valve replacement ; so , the patient will go home on the medications listed below to follow up with Cardiology .
3. Renal artery stenosis .
For this , she had a renal stent as stated above .
We will monitor her potassium levels .
Her renal function is normal at the moment .
4. Hypertension .
Blood pressure is stable at the moment .
We will continue her on the Coreg .
Monitor her blood pressure as needed .
5. Diabetes type 2 .
She will go home on her usual medications .
6. History of CHF .
For this , we will continue her on the digoxin .
The patient is being discharged home on the following medications :
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily .
2. Coreg 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily .
4. Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily .
5. Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily .
6. Humulin insulin 70/30 , 40 units in the a.m. , 28 units in p.m.
7. Zocor 40 mg p.o. daily .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. **NAME[RRR QQQ] as an outpatient at the **INSTITUTION , **INSTITUTION .
She will follow up with Cardiology as an outpatient as well .
The cardiologist had a long discussion with the patient 's son as regards the need for the procedure , the risk , and the benefit .
At the moment , they are undecided on whether she is going to get a procedure or not .

I am managing this critically ill , **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male , who is recovering from pancreatitis .
His course has been complicated by an SMA aneurysm , status post repair , as well as an infected phlegmon , status post debridement , with ARDS and subsequent respiratory insufficiency. I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the general surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure :
Chest x-ray today shows some decrease in his bilateral infiltrates .
Last night I rested him on BiPAP .
This morning he has done much better off the BiPAP with comfortable respiratory rate between 18 and 24 breaths per minute , oxygen saturations in the mid - 90s on the 6 liter oximyzer .
I would like to try and to keep him off BiPAP tonight if possible .
He is starting to developed a little bit of the decubitus of the bridge of his nose .
I have asked Wound Care to come by and see that .
2. Pancreatitis :
The abdomen is soft , he is tolerating his tube feeds at his goal rate and clinically he seems to be improving .
His white blood cell count is 4.9 and he has been afebrile .
He remains on Meropenem as well as linezolid for treatment of his infection .
3. ICU prophylaxis :
He is being tube fed at his goal rate .
His albumin level was 2.1 today , prealbumin is still pending .
His glycemic control has been adequate .
He is on Heparin dose for his SMA repair , but he has had some bleeding from the lower aspect of the wound .
If he continues to bleed , I will be obligated to turn off the Heparin , at this point .
He is a little bit dry intervascularly and I have decreased his Lasix dose .
He continues to diurese nicely .
TOTAL CRITICAL CARE TIME EQUALS 40 MINUTES

FENa was 0.37 .
RADIOLOGY / IMAGING :
Renal ultrasound was normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is an 83 - year-old male with a history of diabetes , steroid-treated polymyalgia rheumatica , hypertension , benign prostatic hypertrophy , and high cholesterol without presented to the hospital for lower extremity angiograph ; however , that was deferred due to new onset renal failure .
1. RENAL FAILURE :
The patient was initially thought to be prerenal , and his renal status improved after hydration and increased oral intake .
He did have a magnetic resonance angiography of his kidneys which showed mild right-sided renal artery stenosis .
His renal function fluctuated throughout his hospital stay , and when he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit he did have decreased urine output in the setting of cardiogenic shock .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient with severe peripheral vascular disease .
During his hospital stay , he developed some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia .
He also became hypotensive on 07-02 in the setting of infection .
The patient had a central line placed and went into sustained ventricular tachycardia that was treated with lidocaine .
After being treated with lidocaine , the patient became apneic requiring intubation and transfer to the Coronary Care Unit .
His nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was treated with a lidocaine drip .
It was found that he had elevated troponins and likely an ischemic event on the 07-02 .
A repeat echocardiogram showed a decreased ejection fraction from prior .
He had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease .
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted , and due to the patient 's acute illness , they wanted to re-evaluate after the patient was extubated .
The patient continued to have intermittent episodes of ventricular tachycardia .
He was continued on lidocaine and eventually changed over to amiodarone .
He was noted to be cardiogenic shock requiring pressors .
Of note , he likely suffered a second ischemic event during his Coronary Care Unit stay .
The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter in place and had a low cardiac output .
The patient 's family eventually decided to withdraw care , and the patient was extubated and passed away on 2009-07-12 .
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin for a left lower lobe infiltrate and a urinary tract infection .
He then developed positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to levofloxacin , and that was continued .
When the patient became hypotensive and required intubation and pressors , his antibiotics were broadened , and he was put on stress-dose steroids .
He was found to have bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia .
3. PULMONARY :
The patient required intubation in the setting of hypotension and ventricular tachycardia .
He was actually extubated on 07-09 , but then reintubated one hour later due to hypoxia .
He was also found to have a bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia .

CT scan of the head showed no hemorrhage or edema .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 with normal intervals and ST wave inversions and early R wave progression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management for acute GI bleed .
1. Gastrointestinal bleed :
The patient continued to receive blood transfusions on the floor and serial hematocrits with serial INR checks were drawn .
As he was receiving his third unit of packed red blood cells , the patient became tachycardic and short of breath .
His temperature raised from 98.6 F. , to 101.0 F.
He was shown to have rigors .
The transfusion was stopped and the patient was given Tylenol 1 mg with epinephrine , 100 mg of hydrocortisone , 25 mg of Benadryl and Demerol 15 as well as Pepcid .
He had emesis times three of 75 cc of coffee ground material .
The patient also desaturated to the low 80 s and was started on a non-rebreather mask .
His saturations improved quickly on 100% non-rebreather mask within 15 to 20 minutes .
Shortly after his mental status changed ; he became disoriented and euphoric and continued to be in this state for two more hours .
After that period of time , his mental status gradually improved and he continued to receive his blood transfusions requiring a total of ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma to reach a hematocrit of 30.0 , which remained stable for the duration of his stay .
On admission , the patient was started on high dose proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis .
On Wednesday , 11-25 , an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was significant for the following findings :
Medium hiatal hernia , Barrett's esophagus , erosion of the gastroesophageal junction , granularity , erythema and congestion of the antrum in the pre-pyloric region compatible with gastritis .
Erosions in the antrum and pre-pyloric region , granularity , erythema and congestion of the anterior bulb and posterior bulb compatible with duodenitis .
It was recommended by Gastroenterology that the patient is to stay off aspirin for at least four to six weeks at discharge to prevent further bleeding .
2. Cardiovascular :
During transfusion reaction episode , the patient had an episode of tachycardia ranging from 134 to 158 , for one to two hours .
EKG during this episode was taken and showed sinus tachycardia ; however , serial enzymes were significant for CK peaking at 1075 , MB peaking at 114 and MB index peaking at 10.8 , consistent with myocardial damage .
The day following this episode , EKG showed loss of R wave progression in anterior leads and Q waves in leads III and AVF consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarction .
The patient 's blood pressures remained stable during his stay .
He had no episodes of arrhythmia on Telemetry .
Cardiology consultation was obtained .
The myocardial infarction was attributed to demand ischemia secondary to acute hematocrit drop exacerbated by tachycardia secondary to blood transfusion reaction .
Further Cardiologic work-up was suggested as an outpatient at four to six weeks post discharge .
The patient was started on Lopressor , Lipitor and Lisinopril .
3. After ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma transfusions , the patient 's hematocrit remained stable at above 30 .
His INR decreased to 1.3 at the time of discharge .
He required no blood transfusions for four days prior to discharge .
4. History of pulmonary embolism likely secondary to frequent flying .
The need for further anti-coagulation was discussed with the patient 's attending , Dr. Coleman , and it was decided not to continue anti-coagulation due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient remained symptom free during his stay in the hospital , saturating well in room air .
5. Endocrine :
The patient was restarted on Levothyroxine soon after admission .
His hemoglobin A1C was sent and it was pending at the time of discharge .
6. Single mental status change times two hours during episode of blood transfusion reaction .
Was most likely due to multiple drugs administered during the episode including Demerol .
After this episode , the patient 's mental status remained clear for the rest of the duration of his stay .
7. Prophylaxis :
The patient was sent home on proton pump inhibitors .
His Helicobacter pylori serology was sent and was pending at the time of discharge .
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged to home on the following medications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day .
2. Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. twice a day .
3. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day .
4. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. day .
5. Levothyroxine 100 micrograms p.o. q. day .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :

Baby Barbara Stead is a term infant admitted with increasing head circumference and bruising .
He was born to a 31-year-old G1 P0 now 1 mother with unremarkable prenatal screens as follows :
O positive , antibody negative , hepatitis B surface antigen negative , RPR nonreactive , rubella immune
PREGNANCY HISTORY :
Estimated date of delivery was 2012-05-14 for estimated gestational age of 39-1/7 weeks .
Pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios with an AFI of 3.5 and by multiple evaluations for decreased fetal movement .
There was spontaneous onset of labor progressing through vacuum assisted vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia .
clear amniotic fluid , no antepartum maternal fever or fetal tachycardia , no antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis .
Baby was vigorous at delivery , was bulb suction , dried , and had free flow oxygen administered briefly .
Apgars were nine and nine .
In the Newborn Nursery , he initially had a caput which increased in the amount of swelling and bruising in the subsequent 24 hours .
He was then referred to the CMED CCU for assessment and management of the increased bleeding .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE CMED CCU :
Birth weight was 3850 grams .
Head circumference was 41 cm .
HEENT was significant for swelling of the scalp tissue in generalized distribution with ecchymosis extending from the occiput to the posterior auricular area and dorsal aspect of the neck to the mid cervical level .
Ears were displaced forward .
Eyes were normal .
Neck and mouth were normal .
No nasal flaring .
Chest :
No retractions , good breath sounds bilaterally , no crackles .
Cardiovascular :
Regular , rate , and rhythm .
Femoral pulses normal , S1 , S2 were normal .
There was a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur in the upper left sternal border without radiation .
Abdomen was soft , nontender , no organomegaly , no masses .
Bowel sounds are active and patent .
CNS active , responsive to stimulation .
Pupils are reactive to light .
Tone is normal , moving all limbs symmetrically , irritable with palpation of the scalp .
Suck , root , gag , grasp , and morrow were normal .
Skin :
Pale as above , nonicteric .
Musculoskeletal :
Normal spine , hip , clavicles , small mass at the site of previous right quadriceps intramuscular injection .
An initial head CT scan had revealed extracranial soft tissue swelling most prominently at the right frontal-parietal-occipital area extending to the left and to the upper cervical region .
Ventricles were symmetrical and not compressed .
No gross intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
But upon further radiology attending Stoughton , there was a small bilateral occipital subdural hemorrhage noted .
The initial hematocrit was 21.2 , platelets 186 .
PT was 14.6 , PTT 77 with an INR of 1.4 .
Fibrinogen was 192 .
D-dimer was negative .
ASSESSMENT :
This is a term infant with significant subgaleal hematoma with apparent extension over the past six hours .
There was also elevation of the PTT suggesting possible inborn coagulopathy .
There is also critical anemia secondary to the subgaleal hemorrhage .
He was admitted to the CMED CCU for further management .
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS :
1. Respiratory :
Patient has been on room air maintaining sats above 95% .
No apnea or bradycardia .
2. Cardiovascular :
There was an initial murmur on admission likely secondary to severe anemia which has since resolved .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout this admission .
3. FEN :
Patient was restarted on po feeds as of day of life three after the bleeding had stabilized .
He has been taking breast milk or Enfamil 20 po adlib .
His admission weight was 3850 grams .
His weight on discharge was 4055 .
4. GI :
Given the significant amount of bleeding , baby was started prophylactically on phototherapy .
His bilirubin peaked on day of life three at 5.4 with a subsequent bilirubin of 4.6 at which time phototherapy was discontinued .
5. Hematology :
Given the rapid extension of the subgaleal bleed , coagulopathy workup was initiated revealing an elevated PTT level of 77 as well as factor 8 level that was below detection in the presence of normal factors 5 , 9 , 10 , and 11 .
He was started on a 50 units / kg bolus of factor 8 followed by continuous factor 8 infusions at 50 units / kg / day divided until hourly infusion rates at 05-10 .
Subsequent factor 8 levels varied with an initial factor 8 level of 18 after the bolus with which he received another bolus of factor 8 of 50 units / kg and increased factor 8 infusion rate to 65 units / kg / day .
As of 05-17 , he was switched over to bolus infusion in preparation of continued home factor 8 administration .
His peak level after a bolus of 75 units / kg of factor 8 was 131 .
A trough level at 20 hours after the bolus on day of discharge was 29 .
He will continue to receive factor 8 bolus q day for a total of 2-3 weeks in light of the intracranial hemorrhage , and will be followed by Hematology visiting nurse Michael Edwards level checks at home .
Currently , the infusion of factor 8 are going through a jugular Broviac which was placed on 05-15 for administration of factor .
His last PTT on 05-16 was 68.3 .
The last hematocrit was on 05-16 of 54.5 .
6. Neurology :
Baby Mary Stead initially presented with significant subgaleal bleed as well as a small subdural hemorrhage .
A repeat head CT scan on 05-15 had shown the resolution of the subdural hematoma and significant improvement of the subgaleal bleed .
His head ultrasound on 05-14 reveals no interventricular hemorrhage .
He had remained neurologically stable .
His head circumference on 05-18 was 36.5 cm with a maximum head circumference on
admission of 40.5 cm .

Reportedly , x-rays showed L4 - L5 spondylolisthesis .
MRI showed the same with some central spinal canal stenosis .
The remainder of the history and physical is as written without additions or deletions .
Because of the patient 's progressive and severe nature of the symptoms and the fact that he did not improve with all the usual conservative modalities , surgical intervention was offered .

The patient was seen and examined by myself .
Laboratory values and chest x-ray film were reviewed by myself .
He remains in the Intensive Care Unit and suffers from the following problems :
1. Respiratory failure - The patient is status post laryngectomy and right neck dissection .
He remains on mechanical ventilation .
We tried to wean him yesterday ; however , he did not tolerate that .
Today , he is doing well on pressure support of 10 .
The plan is to wean that to a tracheostomy mask .
The patient had a significant history of COPD , and I am afraid if we do not get him off the ventilatory quickly , we might have difficulty getting him off the ventilator , so we will be a little more aggressive .
I have already gave the instructions to the respiratory therapist to do so .
2. COPD - The patient is on multiple medication for that including theophylline .
We will continue on that , and we will continue on albuterol and Atrovent .
3. DVT prophylaxis - He is on SCDs and also on heparin .
4. GI prophylaxis - He is receiving Pepcid .
I SPENT A TOTAL OF 32 MINUTES ASSESSING , EVALUATING , AND MANAGING MR. **NAME[AAA] .

At Dr. **NAME[TTT] 's request , I assumed care of the patient and continued Dr. **NAME[TTT] 's overall therapy .
We felt that the blood sugar should be better controlled , and we resumed the home dose of glipizide , but we utilized metformin instead of Avandia to avoid the fluid retention and other side effects of the thiazolidinediones .
Also , weight loss hopefully would be a positive event in this morbidly obese patient .
We discontinued the IV fluids but also switched from IV to oral Lasix .
Rocephin 1 gram IV daily was instituted .
The Mefoxin was 850 mg b.i.d.
A PICC line had to be inserted on **DATE[Mar 23 07] , for difficulty maintaining vascular access .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Jan 10 2008]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Jan 13 08]
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old male postoperative day number three from laryngectomy .
I am currently managing this critically ill patient in the Transplant ICU for respiratory failure , pulmonary edema , hypertension , and COPD .
I have examined Mr. **NAME[AAA] both in the morning and afternoon today and I have personally reviewed the patient 's medications as well as all the historical , laboratory , microbiologic and radiologic data pertinent to his care .
All ICU management has been given under my direction .
The patient has been stable from a hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint overnight but continues to require mechanical ventilation for respiratory support .
He has been difficult to wean from the ventilator previously .
PROBLEMS :
1. Respiratory failure with pulmonary edema .
The patient 's oxygen saturation is 98% on AC mode with a rate of 12 , 40% FIO2 , tidal volume of 600 and PEEP of 5 .
Chest x-ray shows severe COPD with pulmonary venous congestions and a questionable left lower lobe infiltrate .
Given that the patient 's white blood cell count is unremarkable and the patient has been afebrile , I suspect that the infiltrate is due to volume overload rather to an infection .
I have therefore given Lasix 20 mg IV times one and will place the patient on a trach mask trial today .
Overnight , given the patient 's COPD , I will maintain oxygen saturations between 90 and 95% .
This will likely mean reducing the FIO2 from 40% to 30 or even 25% .
2. Hypertension .
The patient 's blood pressure is slightly high at 170/80 .
The patient is already on his regular antihypertensive medications including metoprolol and Univasc .
I suspect that his hypertension may be due simply to volume overload and I will wait to see how the diuresis affects the blood pressure before I add an additional medication .
I have otherwise continued current care including Pepcid and heparin for ICU prophylaxis .
I have continued enteral nutrition with Crucial at 45 mL / hour , discontinued the arterial line and decreased the sliding scale insulin to a low dose scale q. 6 hours for glycemic control .
The time I have spent managing this patient today , exclusive of teaching time and billable procedures , is 40 minutes .

Also , T wave inversions in II , III , aVF , V1 through V5 ; new evolving right bundle-branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 52 - year-old female with no known history of cardiac disease presenting with dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness , who was admitted for evaluation and management of her symptoms .
1. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was admitted for complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure which could be consistent with angina .
However , given the long duration of the symptoms and negative workup in the past , it was thought to be unlikely .
However , the patient was started on an aspirin as well as a beta blocker , and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol was initiated .
A stress thallium was planned for the day following admission .
However , on the night of admission the patient was found lying in her bed diaphoretic and obtunded , and a code was called .
Further examination revealed a strong palpable pulse with a systolic blood pressure in the 130 s and a heart rate in the 80 s.
Over the course of the next few minutes the patient became increasingly more responsive .
She was treated with a fluid bolus .
The patient quickly responded to a fluid bolus and became interactive .
She reported that she was sitting on the commode urinating and began to feel nauseous and presyncopal .
She was able to get to bed at which point she passed out .
She denied any chest pain or pressure , and no shortness of breath during this event .
A rhythm check obtained during the time of this event demonstrated a pause of six seconds followed by a junctional escape rhythm .
An electrocardiogram obtained after the code demonstrated no acute changes .
Her acute bradycardic event was felt likely secondary to her new beta blocker in conjunction with a vagal response .
It was determined to stop the beta blocker , and atropine was placed at the bedside .
On the following day the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated dilated right ventricle secondary to chronic dysfunction and a pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 100 .
Her stress test was cancelled .
A CT angiogram was ordered to evaluate for chronic thromboembolic disease as a potential cause of her pulmonary hypertension .
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of normal enzymes and continued to be monitored on telemetry .
A Pulmonary consultation was obtained to evaluate for possible etiology of the patient 's hypotension .
There was little evidence to suggest any cardiac disease , and given the patient 's Grave's disease an autoimmune process was felt to be possible .
In addition , consideration was given to sarcoidosis , human immunodeficiency virus , and drug-induced given her history of herbal medication use .
It was recommended that the patient begin anticoagulation given the severity of her pulmonary hypertension .
It was also planned to undergo a right heart catheterization with a vasodilation trial by the catheterization laboratory .
A right heart catheterization was performed on 2014-12-05 .
A pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator challenge was performed with a positive response .
In addition , a CT angiogram of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol showed no intravascular filling defect but did show a right upper lobe ground-glass and scattered adenopathy .
Therefore , in the end left atrial hypertension was essentially ruled out as a primary cause .
Chronic pulmonary embolus was less likely given her negative CT angiogram .
Chronic lung disease was unlikely given the patient 's normal pulmonary function tests and DLCO in 2012 as well as a normal CT angiogram .
Collagen vascular disease could not be definitively ruled out ; however , given the patient 's lack of connective tissue disorder stigmata it was thought to be less likely , and the patient 's human immunodeficiency virus test was negative .
Therefore , it was felt that the patient was most likely experiencing a primary pulmonary hypertension .
Consideration was given to treating the patient with a course of calcium channel blocker ; however , given the patient 's poor response to Lopressor , it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient 's pulmonary hypertension .
Therefore , her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of Flolan as a treatment .
Plans were made for placement of a Hickman catheter and initiation of Flolan treatment .
However , on 12-07 , the patient once again experienced an episode of unresponsiveness .
Upon arrival by the physician the patient was awake , alert , and oriented with a pulse in the 80 s, with pressure in the 80 s, and satting 100% on room air .
She described this episode as an uncomfortable feeling in her chest .
The patient was treated with 2 liters of intravenous fluids with a bump in her systolic blood pressure to the 90 s.
Review of telemetry revealed an 8 to 9 beat episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia followed by an episode of bradycardia to 60 beats per minute .
The etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear , but was felt likely secondary to the patient 's tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear pulmonary hypertension , was very preload dependent , and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular compression by a dilated left ventricle .
Given the patient 's persistent hypotensive episodes , and decreased urine output , she was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management prior to initiation of Flolan therapy .
On 12-08 , the Hickman catheter was placed in preparation of Flolan administration .
During the Mass. Mental Health Center Medical Intensive Care Unit stay , the patient was found to exquisitely preload dependent and responded well to aggressive fluids as needed to maintain her blood pressure with a systolic of greater than 90 .
She had no further episodes of bradycardia during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay .
In addition , the patient 's urine output improved dramatically with hydration therapy , suggesting her low urine output was secondary to decreased cardiac output secondary to low preload .
The patient continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service , who determined that the patient was demonstrating severe vasal sensitivity with bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement .
This was to be deferred until after the patient had her Hickman in place .
Because the patient 's pulmonary pressures responded so well to adenosine during right heart catheterization , it was thought that the patient would be a good candidate for Flolan therapy .
Flolan was initiated on 12-08 at 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .
The patient was monitored for symptoms of Flolan therapy including nausea , vomiting , first bite jaw claudication , or hypotension .
Over the course of the hospital stay the patient 's Flolan dose was titrated to receive maximum benefit without precipitating symptoms of Flolan overdose .
The patient was felt to be stable on her current Flolan dose and was therefore transferred back to the floor .
A high resolution CT was requested to further evaluate for possible secondary cause of her primary pulmonary hypertension ; however , the patient refused it at this time .
Plans for placement of a pacemaker were initiated .
However , on the night prior to the planned surgical date the patient suffered an episode of bleeding from her Hickman catheter site .
Surgery was notified and pressure was applied ; however , it did not stop oozing .
A surgicel dressing was placed and prolonged pressure resulted in resolution of the bleeding .
In addition , an extra stitch was placed in an effort to stop the bleeding .
Following this episode the patient felt like she was " too stressed " for pacemaker placement .
Therefore , she was monitored over the next few days for any further bleeding events .
Over the course of the next few days the patient became more accustomed to her Flolan , and Flolan teaching was continued .
She continued to have occasional episodes of dizziness , shortness of breath , and hypotension whenever the alarm sounded suggesting that the Flolan bag needed to be changed .
However , over the course of the hospital stay these decreased both in frequency and severity .
On 12-15 , the patient went for placement of a pacemaker .
She had dual-mode , dual-pacing , dual-sensing pacemaker placed with a lower rate at 60 ppm , and upper rate of 120 ppm with a paced AV of 150 msec .
The patient recovered well from her surgery for pacemaker placement .
At the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating her Flolan therapy well .
She had received a full course of Flolan teaching and reported that she and her husband felt comfortable with the administration of the medication at home .
She was set up with a primary pulmonary hypertension support group , and home services were arranged to help her in the initiation of Flolan therapy .
Following pacemaker placement the patient had no further episodes of bradycardia on telemetry , and therefore she was discharged in satisfactory condition .
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient had no signs or symptoms of infection at the time of admission .
However , she was noted to have a relatively elevated white blood cell count that remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .
However , near the end of her hospitalization the patient began describing increased urinary frequency which persisted once her Foley catheter was removed .
A urinalysis was positive and urine culture grew enterococcus which was pan sensitive .
Therefore , the patient was started on levofloxacin therapy to complete a 10 - day course .
Following initiation of the antibiotic the patient 's white blood cell count quickly came down , and she remained afebrile .
At the time of discharge , the patient still had a mildly elevated white blood cell count but was asymptomatic with a normal temperature .
She will complete two more days of Levaquin therapy as an outpatient .
3. RENAL :
The patient 's BUN and creatinine were followed over the course of her hospital stay .
These remained stable and within normal limits .
It was felt that the decreased urine output was secondary to her preload dependence , and that her urine output increased significantly when she was adequately hydrated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
4. GASTROINTESTINAL :
The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease .
She was continued on Protonix over the course of her hospital stay and had no further gastrointestinal issues .
5. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient 's hematocrit remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .
Despite bleeding from the Hickman site , she did not require any transfusion therapy .
6. FLUIDS / ELECTROLYTES / NUTRITION :
The patient tolerated a regular diet throughout the course of her hospital stay .
Her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and remained within normal limits , being replaced as needed .
She was discharged to home on a regular diet .
7. ENDOCRINE :
The patient with a history of hypothyroidism .
She was continued on her regular Synthroid dose .
She will need a TSH and T4 checked as an outpatient .
8. CODE STATUS :
The patient is a full code .
9. FLOLAN ADMINISTRATION :
At the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating a Flolan dose of 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .
A Physical Therapy consultation was obtained to initiate a 6 - minute walk test .
On room air , the patient 's oxygen saturation was 95% and dropped to 88% following a 6 - minute walk .
The patient was discharged to home with appropriate Flolan teaching and supplies .
She was to follow up with Dr. Savage in the Clinic the following week .

CONDITION C:
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old patient who was admitted under the Renal Transplant service .
This is a woman with a history of chronic renal failure who has had two failed kidney transplants in the past .
She came with what appeared to be an abdominal wound infection for which she had placed a VAC in the surgical wound , and she was eventually transferred to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] 's service , and she was seen by one of these two physicians early today .
The patient was found to have a blood pressure of 73/40 .
They have requested that the patient get an IV bolus .
The patient had very poor IV access .
They had requested that the IV team had a new attempt for IV access .
This was not successful .
Then they requested that the patient have a PICC line , which was not successful , and four hours later while the patient continued to have a blood pressure of about 72/40 , we were asked to see this patient .
A condition C was called because of persistent hypotension and inability to obtain IV access .
When I saw the patient on the floor , the patient was awake and alert with adequate mentation .
Her blood pressure was 78/40 .
We measured her blood pressure in only one arm because she has a fistula in the left arm .
She had a good pulse in the femoral region , and she never had any compromise in mentation .
She was complaining of abdominal pain .
I proceeded to place a femoral line in the left femoral vein .
This was done with some difficulty because the patient has a history of previous cut - downs in this area .
She had some scars in this area .
We put in a triple - lumen catheter without complication with no hematoma into her left femoral vein , and we were able to give her a couple of boluses of IV fluids .
Her blood pressure improved .
Her oxygen saturation remained about 100% .
Once the line was placed , I re - examined the patient , and she complained of progressive worsening abdominal pain with some guarding in the lower right quadrant .
This appeared to be a new finding according to her nurse practitioner , although none of these findings had been reported earlier today .
The patient was transferred immediately to a CCU MICU bed for her to be aggressively resuscitated and for her to be studied for possible intra - abdominal sepsis .
I requested that she have an abdominal CT when she is more stable .
I , Dr. **NAME[XXX] , was present during the entire resuscitation for a total of 32 minutes .
This is not including the time that I spent placing the central line .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 56 - year-old man without any significant past medical history who presented to the emergency room after the sudden onset of headache while he was riding a bicycle .
He characterized this headache as the worst headache of his life and had associated nausea and vomiting times one .
He also complained of dizziness at the time of headache onset .
He presented to the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial VA Hospital emergency room , where an initial head CT scan was read as negative .
However , a lumbar puncture was done , in which tube 1 showed 4800 red blood cells and tube 4 showed 4000 red blood cells .
The patient was sent for an MRI of the head , which raised the question of a right posterior cerebral artery aneurysm .
The CT scan was revealed and , on second analysis , it was thought that it was suspicious for a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern .
The patient was then admitted for further evaluation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The past medical history was significant for left shoulder surgery in 2014-03-06 for repair of a " minor rotator cuff tear " and removal of osteophytes .
Otherwise , the past medical history was insignificant .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
The patient was on no medications .
ALLERGIES :
There were no known drug allergies .

Of note , the patient had been given 2 mg of Ativan before the examination .
The face was symmetric .
The tongue was midline .
The neck was supple with full range of motion .
There was no rigidity , but the neck was slightly painful at extreme flexion .
The general examination was essentially unremarkable , as per previous notes .
On examination of the extremities , the patient moved all extremities and had strength of 5/5 in all of the muscle
groups tested in the upper and lower extremities .
The sensory examination was intact to light touch .
There was a very slight inward pronator drift of the left hand .
Finger - nose - finger testing and heel - to - shin testing were normal .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. Laymie Fournier and Dr. Leebjescobe in Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in May 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .
He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .
A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He was started on aspirin .
He has a family history of hypertension as well .
He was also placed on Vasotec .
A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
A thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 140/100 , phosphorus 94 , weight 181 lb .
Head , neck :
unremarkable .
Lungs clear .
Carotids normal .
Cardiac :
Loud S4 and a II / VI regurgitant murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological :
Nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 104 , CO2 28 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 243 .
Cholesterol 197 , triglycerides 118 , HDL 31 , LDL 142 , total protein 6.2 , bilirubin 1.0 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , SGOT 23 .
Hematocrit on admission was 43% with a white blood count of 6600 .
MCV was 85 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .
This lowered with IV nitroglycerin .
Selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .
He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
The situation was reviewed with his wife , Sligh .
She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the Leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .
It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .
He developed epigastric pain on 07/31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. Slusslashgodle , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .
On 08/02/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .
He had good hemodynamics .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .
He had a right bundle branch block .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew .

Transfer Note
The patient is being transferred from ICU to a regular floor .
The patient was admitted through the emergency department to the ICU on **DATE[Aug 5 2007] , for chief complaint of fever .
The patient actually complained of feeling nauseated and vomited about 4 times .
He had dialysis on Sunday , instead of Monday ; and after dialysis , he felt nauseated and vomited about 2 to 3 times .
Ever since , he also had a headache .
He complained of fever and chills , and also had a cough and some mild sputum production .
The patient is having end - stage renal disease , on hemodialysis on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday .
He has multiple dialysis access sites failed .
He has a history of hypertension ; however , now is on the lower side as far as the blood pressures are concerned .
Also , he has a history of anemia , pancreatitis , hyperparathyroidism , and he had a motor vehicle accident in 1997 , followed by hip replacement surgery .
Admission diagnosis in ICU was sepsis , possibly related to the Uldall catheter that the patient has on the right subclavian vein .
The patient had a fever of 104 in the emergency department , and later on , during the ICU course , the patient was afebrile , basically the signs of sepsis resolved , the patient continued to improve .
He underwent hemodialysis on Saturday .
He continued to be anuric .
He received vancomycin in the emergency department .
His blood pressure improved with normal saline boluses .
He was given initially vancomycin , but later on , he also received Zosyn 2.25 g IV q.8 h. which was discontinued ; for DVT prophylaxis , heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d. , PhosLo , Nephrocaps , and Os-Cal , and also Epogen 10,000 units IV every hemodialysis .
Urine culture could not be obtained because the patient was anuric .
Dr. **NAME[VVV] from infectious diseases was involved in the case .
The patient received another dose of vancomycin 500 mg IV plus hemodialysis on Saturday .
Next hemodialysis is due on Monday .
Blood cultures revealed no growth in 2 days , so the patient was cultured just from the peripheral blood .
He did have gram-positive cocci in cluster growth in one of 2 bottles .
The vancomycin level was 7.7 on **DATE[Aug 6 2007] .
The patient is due for another vancomycin level after next hemodialysis or at the end of the next hemodialysis , this will be on Monday , **DATE[Aug 8 2007] .
Culture from the nose was negative for MRSA .
Dr. **NAME[UUU] followed the patient as well from the nephrology standpoint .
Dr. **NAME[VVV] wanted Dr. **NAME[TTT] __________ regarding onychomycosis .
Dr. **NAME[TTT] saw the patient and performed the debridement of nails 1 to 5 , 6 through 10 with alcohol applied .
The patient 's right lower extremity is definitely bigger in diameter than the left lower extremity , rule out DVT , lower extremity venous Doppler was performed , actually the preliminary report reveals right popiteal DVT .
The patient was started on heparin protocol .
Today upon transfer , Coumadin 500 mg p.o. daily was started with the mentioning of close monitoring of PT , PTT , and INR per infectious diseases , Dr. **NAME[VVV] saw the patient today and he believes that the fever on admission was most likely secondary to DVT .
Another temperature reported during the ICU stay was 102 .
Hypertension and sepsis like picture were possibly secondary to dehydration .
The sepsis is clinically resolved .
His blood cultures are negative , and sepsis has resolved .
Dr. **NAME[VVV] believes that no further antibiotic therapy is necessary at this time .
He will follow the patient on the regular floor .
The patient is to have a vancomycin level at the end of next hemodialysis on Monday .
Per nephrology note , all non-emergent blood work only on dialysis days .
The patient is to continue on heparin protocol for now , we will discontinue further IV vancomycin dosing .
The patient was transferred in stable condition .
MEDICATIONS UPON DISCHARGE :
1. Magnesium oxide , today and tomorrow .
2. Nephrocaps one daily .
3. Os-Cal one t.i.d.
4. PhosLo one capsule t.i.d.
5. Procrit 10,000 units and continue heparin protocol and start Coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily .
This was a transfer note on the patient from the ICU to the regular floor .

Attending : Cindy U. Kelly , M.D.
Chief Complaint :
transfer from OSH , seizure
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Lumbar puncture
History of Present Illness :
Ms. Swanson is a 53 yo woman with PMH significant for seizure disorder , brain injury , and ? atypical multiple sclerosis who presents with right face twitch and right arm shaking .
History is obtained from her sister , William from Lawrence General Hospital , and from her primary neurologist , Dr. Brian .
She lives in an assisted living , and was noted yesterday to have generalized tonic-clonic activity beginning on the right side and lasting 90 minutes .
EMS gave her valium 5 mg pr at the facility and brought her to Barnstable County Hospital .
She persisted with right sided seizure activity there and was given valium 10 mg and ativan 1 mg , as well as loaded with dilantin 1000 mg .
She was transferred to the Providence Behavioral Health Hospital CMED .
Here she was given an additional valium 5 mg x 2 and ativan 1 mg x 3 for persistent twitching in her face and right hand .
Since the ativan , her facial twitching has apparently improved , but she continues to have hand twitches .
She also had an EEG , which showed left sided slowing on preliminary read .
Apparently she has a long history of seizure disorder , possibly from a history of traumatic brain injury ( though per Dr. Paula , 
records from that hospitalization indicate she may have only had a very mild injury ) and has been managed on dilantin and keppra .
Since she has seen Dr. Ollie , she has had at least two episodes of status epilepticus and one generalized seizure , as well as some less significant seizures which are characterized by left gaze preference and left sided tonic-clonic activity .
Her dilantin levels had been somewhat difficult to control .
He tried adding lamictal , but this caused a rash .
At the time of her last visit ( 2015-03-18 ) Dr. Bradley had discussed the addition of a third Castelluccio , possibly zonegran ( less likely topamax ), to the dilantin 200 mg bid and keppra 1500 mg bid .
Her sister had wanted to keep the current course because she felt she was doing well where she was living and did not want to upset that .
However , she had several dilantin levels drawn since her last visit , with 15.4 in 05 - 23.5 in Theresa , and 3.09 - 18 .
Her sister reports that the medication dose had been changed to 200 mg qam and 100 mg qpm in Theresa , and a review of her Union Hospital - North Shore Medical Center records indicates that this may have occurred in an urgent care appointment secondary to slurred speech and a recent fall and a non-trough level of 15.9 .
According to her sister , the patient has no short-term memory .
She has been living in an assisted living facility and frequently calls her even right after she has left without remembering her visit .
The patient walks with a walker at baseline and goes out for dinner and shopping with her sister .
Ms. Swanson also carries a diagnosis of " atypical MS ", which she brought with her to Dr. Billie .
According to Dr. Nicole , she has had stable deficits for many years without any flare-like episodes .
She had an MRI in 2014 that showed multiple plaque-like lesions , but these were entirely stable since 2010 .
She is not undergoing any treatment .
Reportedly she has been evaluated at Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children , HealthSouth Braintree Rehab Hospital , and possibly St. Elizabeth's Medical Center of Boston .
She has not had an LP as far as Dr. Ginger knows .

CSF cytology : NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS .
Reactive lymphoid cells .
immunotyping negative .
CXR 09-28 : No evidence for pneumonia .
No change since prior study of 2015-09-24 .
CT HEAD FINDINGS : There is moderately severe , confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity surrounding the frontal horns , posterior horns , and more superiorly , involving the centra semiovale .
These findings are unchanged from prior studies , and may relate to the " atypical " demyelinating process , suggested in the indication on the prior MRI ; however , they are non-specific .
There is no evidence of acute intra - or extra - axial hemorrhage .
There is no shift of normally midline structures .
The ventricles are mildly prominent , but are unchanged from the prior study .
There is no interval loss of focal gray - white matter differentiation to suggest acute infarction , though CT is not sensitive in the early stages .
No focal masses is seen .
IMPRESSION :
1) No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect ; no significant interval change from CT of 2015-07-20 .
2) Diffuse , confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity , which may relate to an underlying demyelinating process ( as suggested in the indication provided for the prior MRI ).
The markedly low - attenation ( 14-15 HU ) centered within this process suggests either irreversible demyelination with cavitation (" black hole "), or lacunar infarction on a vascular basis .
Generalized and marked callosal atrophy ( on the MR ) also suggest advanced , irreversible disease .
3) No mass is appreciated on this limited non-contrast study ; if clinically concerned , an MRI with gadolinium is recommended .
MRI : There is a similar configuration of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres , suggesting demyelinating disease .
As previously noted , there is associated volume loss , thinning of the corpus callosum , and slight widening of the ventricles .
On post-contrast images , there is a probably stable appearance of a 5 mm linear , focal area of enhancement in the left centrum semiovale , of uncertain etiology .
Also ehancing is 3 mm linear lesion in the left hippocampal cortex anteriorly , not seen on the 08-20 MR , but that study was very motion - degraded .
The hippocampus would be a most unusual site for involvement by multiple sclerosis .
There is no apparent mass lesion or mass effect .
No changes in the overall morphology of the brain are identified .
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable .
The major vascular flow patterns are normal .
IMPRESSION :
1. Stable appearance of confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter , consistent with severe demyelinating disease .
2. Enhancing lesions in the left centrum semiovale and also left hippocampal cortex .
This former lesion was evident on MR dating back to 2014-08-15 , though is more prominent at this time , likely due to less motion degradation of the current scan .
Etiology of these enhancing lesions is uncertain , but could be atypical manifestations of demyelination .
EEG :
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of generalized theta and delta slowing .
Facial twitching was described by the technologist and seen on the video .
This is primarily right-sided , facial movement clinically and did not appear to involve the forehead or CMED CSRU .
There were no clear EEG correlate .
ABNORMALITY #2: The background voltages were occasionally lower on the left side , and there were additional bursts of delta slowing  seen broadly on the left side alone .
ABNORMALITY #3: The background rhythms were dominated by much faster beta rhythm .
They appeared to reach an 8 Hz frequency on the right at times , though the background was disorganized and slow on both sides for 
much of the recording .
It was of much lower voltage on the left .
HYPERVENTILATION : Could not be performed .
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION : Could not be performed .
SLEEP : No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen .
CARDIAC MONITOR : Showed a generally regular rhythm .
IMPRESSION : Abnormal portable EEG due to the bursts of generalized slowing and additional left-sided slowing and voltage dimunition , along with some slowing of the background .
The generalized and background features indicate a wide-spread encephalopathy .
The left sided slowing and voltage reduction surpassed an additional dysfunction on the left side , possibly wide-spread cortical dysfunction .
There is a possibility of a structural lesion on the left , but the encephalopathy dominated the overall picture .
There were no clear epileptiform discharges .
No EEG correlate was established for the facial twitching .
The lack of EEG correlate to the facial twitching does not exclude a central cause ( and , indeed , this appeared most likely based on the clinical and video observations ).
Brief Hospital Course :
53 yo woman with h/o seizure disorder , demyelinating disease , and brain injury , presents with prolonged seizure , now unresponsive with persistent twitching of right arm and face .
This is most consistent with complex partial seizures with a focus in the left hemisphere , most likely the motor strip .
In the past , her seizures were on the left side , which implies that she now has a new focus .
It is possible that this is secondary to her underlying demyelinating disease , but per report this has not been very active .
Other possibilities include infection , including her UTI .
It is likely that these seizures began due to subtherapeutic dilantin levels on her new dose of 200 mg / 100 mg .
Her seizure management is difficult , given the higher doses were causing her to fall and slur her speech .
Discussed with Dr. Joaquin the addition of an alternate Castelluccio with the possibility of tapering down the dilantin in the future , and he agreed that she may benefit from zonegran .
Cannot use lamictal or depakote due to reactions .
Topamax is another possibility , but not ideal in a patient with preexisting cognitive deficits .
She was started on zonegran at 50 mg daily with plans to increase by 50 mg every other week to a goal dose of 200 mg / day ; she was on 100 mg daily at discharge and should have her dose increased on 10-12 and again on 10-26 .
She was continued on keppra and dilantin with trough checked frequently and adjustment as needed .
Ativan was used for breakthrough seizures ( facial twitching ).
MRI/MRA showed new temporal lesions , but it is unclear if these are the cause or effect of her seizures .
She will need to have a repeat MRI in several months for further evaluation .
LP was done and had no changes to suggest a different etiology ( ie negative cytology and negative immunophenotyping ).
Oligoclonal bands were not assessed as there was not enough CSF per the laboratory .
She will need repeated dilantin troughs with one time dose when trough is subtherapeutic .
Pending tests :
ANGIOTENSIN 1 CONVERTING ENZYME
EBV-PCR
HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS PCR
Ernest VIRUS ( JCV ) DNA PCR
LYME , TOTAL EIA WITH REFLEX TO CSF RATIO
VARICELLA DNA ( PCR )
VDRL
2. atypical MS : discussed with her outpt neurologist ( Dr. Ford in Boston Medical Center ); no current role for MS medications .
MRI was performed and showed new lesions vs sz effects in the left temporal lobe .
She also had a new lesion on her last MRI in the centrum semiovale .
LP was done to evaluate for malignancy , and no malignant cells were seen .
Immunotyping was negative as well ( per verbal report ).
Unfortunately , oligoclonal bands could not be sent from the CSF ( lab sent CSF for other studies and there was not enough left over for OCB s).
This was relayed to the family ( Kirk ).
Given that she does have new lesions on MRI , if OCB s were sent this would have weighed in in her dx of MS , and it's possible she could benefit from MS therapy .
This was relayed to the family , and they will readdress this with Dr. Ford ( MS Hoyos ).
The family is confident in any decision Dr. Ford would make re : therapy for her MS .
3. fevers on admission : Pt w/ positive U/A , treated with bactrim x 3 days with defervescence .
4. depression : continue escitalopram ; assess need to change medication as an outpatient .
5. FEN : NGT was placed given her altered mental status , and she has been unable to pass a swallow evaluation , but has improved .
This should be repeated in several days as her mental status continues to clear .

Left hip pain secondary to severe DJD .
Admission disposition : admit to medical bed .
Medical management :
**AGE[in 80s] yo female with a significant PMH for severe DJD that presented to the ED with severe pain in the left hip .
She had been having troubles with the right hip secondary to her DJD but the left hip had never really bother her .
2 days before admission she started to complain of a minimal complain in the left hip but it was very tolerable so she decided to control this with the same medication she was taking for the right hip pain .
The medication did not help and for the last 12 h the pain had been excruciating so she decided to come to the ED .
She described the pain as an excruciating pain **DATE[Sep 11] , sharp that does not radiate and worst when in motion .
Also her concerned was that her pain was always in the right hip but not in the left .
She denied any fall .
At home she was controlling her pain with tramadol , but not very succesfully .
When admitted x rays were done in ED and no fracture was obvious , we decided to control the pain with oxycodone , that controlled the pain very well but made the patient a bit confuse .
Also she became agitated during her hospitalization probably secondary to being in the hospital , acute distress of the pain and pain medications .
It was neccesary to put her on restraints fro couple of hours but after this she was no agitated so there were taken off and she did not require any more , she recieved risperidone 0.25 PO that seemed to work very well .
Being the pain under controlled now , we will send her to SNF for rehab and also is not safe at home for her given her bilateral hip pain .

Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Chester was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and underwent routine preoperative evaluation .
He remained pain free on medical therapy .
Workup was unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery .
On 04-18 , Dr. Oneill performed off pump coronary artery bypass grafting .
For surgical details , please see seperate dictated operative note .
Following the operation , he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring .
Within 24 hours , he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident .
Given hypotension and bradycardia , he was slow to wean from Neosynephrine .
Low dose beta blockade was eventually resumed .
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed without complication .
On postoperative day three , he transferred to the SDU .
He maintained a normal sinus rhythm without atrial or ventricular arrhythmias .
He remained in sinus bradycardia ( rate 50-60 ) and tolerated low dose beta blockade .
On POD #6 his creatinine became slightly elevated at 1.4 , his lasix was discontinued and the following day his creatinine was stable at 1.4 .
He continued to progress and was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 7 .
His discharge chest x-ray showed persistent bibasilar atelectasis with only tiny pleural effusions .
Of note , he will need to remain on Plavix for three months postop given the off pump procedure .
In addition , he will need to remain on Imdur given use of his right internal mammary artery as a " free " arterial graft in preventing 
vasospasm .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 12 07]
I was asked to some see this **AGE[in 80s]- year - old patient over in Geriatrics and **INSTITUTION admitted for depression and ECT therapy .
She has a past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and COPD .
I was called to evaluate her secondary to worsening respiratory distress .
Apparently , according to history , she started to complain of being shortness of breath , increased work of breathing around 02:00 a.m. this morning .
This apparently worsened over the course of the last few hours .
When I initially saw her , she was hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the 170s .
She was tachypneic with a respiratory rate in the 30s , as well as tachycardic with a heart rate in the 120s .
She was use accessory muscles working fairly hard to breathe and had diffuse coarse rhonchi throughout .
In light of this , gave her 20 mg of Lasix .
She also got several treatments of Xopenex which appeared to offer some relief .
My concern as well was the fact that she had been oxygenating quite well on 5 liters of O2 , and when I evaluated her O2 sat , 5 liters , was only 83% .
So , did put her on a nonbreather mask .
Sats came up to 95 , 96% .
In light of this , I thought it was probably reasonable to go ahead and transfer her to the MICU Service as opposed to a monitored floor service in light of her oxygen requirements and her worsening respiratory status .
There is some concern whether or not she could have aspirated during her ETC therapy which is possibility , could be just exacerbation of COPD and pneumonia .
She does have a history of being recently treated for pneumonia back in **DATE[Feb] of this year .
Hemodynamically , she has remained stable .
She is mentating , a little confused and very cantankerous .
So , at this point in time , I did transfer her to the MICU for further management .
Otherwise continue her current supportive care and management as per the MICU Service .
Critical care time = 31 minutes .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P - 83yo F with valvular disorder , AF , and h/o CAD a/w hypercarbic respiratory failure .
# Respiratory failure - She was admitted to the CMED CSRU for her repiratory failure which was thought to be secondary to CHF .
Pt was diuresed with iv lasix / acetazolamide and given iv morphine / prn for respiratory distress and BIPAP was tried .
However , hypercarbia ( 04-11 metabolic alkalosis ) remained in the 90s .
Pt was mentating okay , having conversations with intermittent somnolence despite hypercarbia .
TTE showed preserved EF with moderate AS and moderate MS and mod pulm HTN .
Cardiology was consulted and thought MS Harold Holcomb to her pulm edema and pulm HTN .
Cardiology recommended d/cing digoxin and starting amiodarone .
Family declined valvuloplasty .
For possible COPD , pt was started on steroids and nebs on 08-03 .
Pt is currently satting 90s on 1 L NC while sitting in a chair but needs more O2 when supine .
Pt is a mouth breather and occasionally needs a face mask .
Pt will need I/Os monitored to goal even to slightly negative as she was diursed 4.8 L during her CMED stay .
Depending on her I/O , lasix and acetazolamide can be decreased or discontinued .
If she were to decompensate at the rehab , goals of care will need to be readdressed .
# h/o CAD - There were new changes on EKG but pt was ruled out with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes .
Pt was continued on BB , ASA , and nitrates .
# Acid / base status - Respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation .
Appears to be chronic in nature given degree of metabolic compensation with acute component earlier today .
Pt failed BIPAP and pCO2 remained in the 90s but maintaining mentation .
# Renal insufficiency - baseline Cr unknown , may have CRI from DM .
Creatinine stayed stable from 1.3-1.5 .
Will need to renally dose all medications .
# A fib - continued BB .
Per cardiology consult recs , discontinued digoxin and started amiodarone .
Due to elevated INR , coumadin was held .
Pt is also paced .
Pt needs to be on amiodarone 400mg BID x 7 days ( loading dose ) and then 400mg daily for maintenance .
# DM - insulin standing + HISS , FS qid
# Depression - continued home regimen
# F/E/N - NPO initially while on BIPAP and now low sodium cardiac diet .
# PPx - supratherpeutic INR
# Access - PIV
# Code - DNR/DNI .
No pressors or central line per HCP .
If she were to decompensate at the rehab , goals of care will need to be readressed .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gastric carcinoma
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
hypothyroidism following near total thyroidectomy .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
On 1/12/92 near total gastrectomy with retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy , portal node dissection , repair of ventral hernia , and needle jejunostomy tube placement .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
None
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Tikrhalt is an 86 year old female , previously healthy , who presents with a 3 month history of dysphagia .
A subsequent workup including upper gastrointestinal series and abdominal computerized tomography scan suggested the presence of a gastric mass .
Endoscopy with biopsy revealed gastric carcinoma , poorly differentiated , within the body of the stomach along the greater curvature .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. Ko for a possible resection of this carcinoma .
She reports a 10 pound weight loss over the past several months .
She denies any abdominal pain .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for an appendectomy in the distant past , cholecystectomy in the past , history of of Cesarean section in the past and a history of near total thyroidectomy for nodular goiter in the past .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Her only medication is Thyrolar for her relative hypothyroidism following resection .
There is a question of an allergy to Tylenol .
She denies any history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease or peptic ulcer disease .
Interestingly , she reports that both her mother and father died of stomach carcinoma .
She is a former smoker , and drinks alcohol occasionally .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is an elderly but spry white female in no acute distress .
Her sclera were nonicteric .
Her oropharynx was clear .
Her neck was supple without masses or bruits noted .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her cardiac examination was unremarkable .
Examination of her abdomen revealed a flat nontender abdomen without palpable masses .
There were multiple well healed surgical scars .
She was guaiac negative .
There was no cva tenderness or spinal tenderness noted .
Her pulses were intact throughout .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 139 , potassium 3.7 and BUN of 19 .
Her hematocrit was 37.2 with a white blood count of 6.6 .
Her Bilirubin direct and total were 0.1 and 0.3 respectively .
Her alkaline phosphatase was 134 .
Her electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without acute ischemic changes .
Chest X-Ray was unremarkable .
The assessment at the time of admission was that of an 86 year old female with poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma , admitted for resection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Service of Dr. Fede A. Duhenile .
On 1/12/92 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy reconstruction .
In addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision .
This was repaired .
A needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition .
With regards to the cancer , there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach , and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen .
In addition , there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen .
The remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic spread elsewhere , including the liver .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition .
The patient 's postoperative course was for the most part unremarkable .
Her wounds healed well without incident and the needle jejunostomy tube was utilized on the first postoperative day right up until the time of discharge , infusing Vivonex T.E.N.
The patient tolerated this without difficulty .
The patient 's nasogastric tube was removed on the 3rd postoperative day , and with the passage of flatus and good bowel sounds noted , she was started on a liquid diet which was advanced slowly .
She was seen by the dietician and was advised with regard to needing numerous small meals during the day rather than 3 larger meals as she previously was used to .
Her ambulation and mobilization increased gradually and by the time of discharge she was walking in the halls without assistance .
As mentioned , her wounds healed well without incident and the staples were removed on the 10th postoperative day just prior to discharge .
She had some difficulties with confusion in the early postoperative period which were attributable to her advanced age and a sundowning effect .
These problems resolved by the 4th or 5th postoperative day and she remained lucid and alert for the remainder of her hospital stay .
Surgical pathology report was completed prior to discharge which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ulcerating and extending through the wall into the serosa of the stomach .
Metastatic carcinoma was present in 3 of 3 lymph nodes .
The gastric resection margins were free of carcinoma .
The patient was set for discharge on the 11th postoperative day doing well .
On the day prior to discharge she complained of some dysuria , a urine specimen was obtained , which showed numerous white cells consistent with a urinary tract infection .
She was started empirically on Bactrim , while culture and sensitivity results were pending and remained pending at the time of this dictation .
She will be discharged to home and will be seen in follow-up by her regular physicians as well as Dr. Ko .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Bactrim , single strength , one p.o. b.i.d. times 10 days , initiated 9/27/92 , Synthroid 0.1 mg p.o. q.day , Ferrous Gluconate 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day .
She will be seen by Visiting Nurses Association to help with general aspects of daily living as well as adequate diet planning following her gastric resection .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
NAME :
LESS , LIESEANALE
UNIT NUMBER :
589-25-50
ADMISSION DATE :
12/16/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
01/16/98
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
End-stage renal disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Right nephrectomy .
2. Cadaveric renal transplant .
3. Acute thrombosis .
4. Transplant nephrectomy .
5. Pulmonary emboli .
6. Hypertension .
7. Coronary artery disease .
8. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
9. Hypercoagulable state .
10. Perforated viscus .
11. Abdominal abscesses .
12. Sepsis .
13. Respiratory failure .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .
These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12/16/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .
A pulmonary arteriogram on 01/03/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12/19/97 .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01/06/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .
The patient remained unstable .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on 01/08/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. Less continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. Less condition was irretrievable .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
Dr. Cantsleddjesc felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on 1/16/98 .

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female with past medical history of depression , atrial fibrillation , and COPD who was transferred to the MICU on **DATE[Nov 12 2007] , from **INSTITUTION with respiratory distress .
The patient has been in **INSTITUTION since **DATE[Oct 20 2007] , for worsening confusion without an organic cause .
She had been receiving electroconvulsive therapy , her last treatment being on **DATE[Nov 11 2007] .
Following this ECT , she had progressively increased work of breathing followed by extubation after her procedure .
She had to get some Xopenex which decreased her O2 requirement .
Saturations were 100% on 6 L of nasal cannula .
She got a chest x-ray at that time which showed right - sided opacities suspicious for pneumonia .
The patient was started on Zosyn and vancomycin .
She did have a tracheal aspirate on **DATE[Nov 12 2006] , which showed moderate gram-positive cocci .
The patient has otherwise been feeling well and she was subsequently transferred to the medicine floor for further treatment .
Subjectively , the patient was seen lying in bed .
She had no specific complaints for me .
Asked me to leave her alone .
She denied any chest pain or shortness of breath .
No abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting .

Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was admitted to Nantucket Cottage Hospital on 2013-03-27 following a motor vehicle crash as described previously .
Chest and pelvis X-rays were negative for fractures .
A CT of her head demonstrated intraparenchymal and extraaxial blood ( mostly subarachnoid ) in bilateral cerebral hemispheres , right greater than left , in a pattern indicating contrecoup injury .
A CT of her C-spine revealed a possible fracture of right C7 pedicle .
A CT of her chest revealed bliateral lung nodules and a right thyroid nodule .
A CT of her sinues revealed no fractures .
X-rays of her right lower extremity were negative for any acute injury .
A neurosurgery consult was obtained .
Our recommendations were to load her with Dilantin and then continue at 100 mg PO TID .
The orthopedics spine service saw her and put her in a C-collar .
She was admitted to the trauma ICU .
A repeat head CT 12 hours after the first was largely unchanged .
She was transferred to step down .
She was having some pain issues and morphine was making her " jittery ."
On HD 2 she was switched to Fioricet , which helped with her headaches .
A repeact head CT was unchanged .
An MRI of her C-spine was done to evaluate for ligamentous injury , but this was extremely limited examination due to patient motion and the signal in the spinal cord could not be adequately assessed for edema .
As per CMED CSRU spine , the patient was instructed to follow-up in 2 weeks for repeat X-rays .
On discharge she was awake , alert and orientated X3 with c/o mild headache .
She had full strength motor exam , no pronator drift and PERRLA with full EOM s.
She was ambulating without difficulties .
On 04-01 she was seen by physical therapy was thought to benefit from acute rehabilitation .
She had a head CT prior to discharge that showed resolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage .
Follow-up in 1 month with neurosurgery for a repeat head CT was arranged .
She was discharged on fioricet and dilantin .
She was counseled to follow-up with her PCP F 6-12 months regading the right thyroid nodule and the bilateral small lung nodules seen on her chest CT .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatocellular carcinoma , and hepatitis C .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Liver transplant .
Native hepatectomy .
Re-exploration for bleeding .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Villesatelkscurb is a fifty year old black gentleman with a long history of hepatitis C , believed to be contracted during transfusions in a previous trauma .
The patient had recently prior to this admission , had a rise in his alpha feta protein and a biopsy of his liver had shown hepatocellular carcinoma .
The patient was admitted for liver transplant workup and to await liver transplant .
PAST MEDICAL and
SURGICAL HISTORY :
Significant for motor vehicle accident in 1966 , requiring exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy , tonsillectomy as a child , pneumonia in the past , hepatitis C and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission medications included Lasix and iron .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Significant for normal head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam with no scleral icterus .
Heart regular rate and rhythm , his lungs were clear .
He had no appreciable ascites .
He did have clubbing and palmar erythema with bilateral ankle edema .
He was Neurologically intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
bilirubin to be .6 .
SGOT of 80 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Preoperatively , the patient underwent chemo-embolization for his hepatocellular carcinoma .
The remainder of his preoperative course was benign .
On July 15 , 1992 , a liver became available , and the patient underwent hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant .
His operation was complicated by severe coagulopathy requiring fifty-nine units of packed red blood cells , 64 units of FFP and 34 units of platelets .
Postoperatively , the patient continued to have a coagulopathy requiring re-exploration on postoperatively day 2 , with findings only of hematoma and no active bleeding .
Initially , the patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit , mentally alert , and oriented , however , he continued to be coagulopathic and was requiring large amounts of blood and FFP transfusions , with a resultant pulmonary edema .
He developed renal failure felt to be ATN secondary to ischemia of his kidneys .
The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for twelve days prior to his death .
He had daily transfusions of FFP and blood , and continued coagulopathy .
He also developed thrombocytopenia , requiring persistent platelet transfusions on a daily basis .
His immunosuppression was OKT3 and Solu Medrol , and he underwent hemodialysis and ultra filtration to remove fluid .
While in the ICU he developed seizures , requiring large amounts of intravenous Valium to break his seizures , and he was maintained on Tegretol and Dilantin .
However , he became progressively more mentally obtunded .
During the seizure , he bit his tongue , resulting in a large bleed from his tongue , which was sutured by the ENT Service , however , his continued coagulopathy resulted in bleeding from his nasopharynx , which could never be identified , and also upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
Endoscopy never revealed specific sources of bleeding , although he appeared to have a diffuse duodenitis .
He was started on Pitressin to try to control the gastrointestinal bleeding , but he continued to have severe bleeding , and became progressively hypotensive , with eventual bradycardia and cardiac arrest .
He was pronounced dead at 3:49 PM on July 15 , 1992 .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 12 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 18 07]
I was called to evaluate the patient since she was complaining of increasing shortness of breath .
This was around one o 'clock this afternoon .
I went and evaluated the patient .
The patient was complaining of increasing shortness of breath , however she was maintaining her airway .
She was arousable and she was saying that she has some shortness of breath .
She did not complain of any chest pain and vital signs around that time showed that she was sating 96% on 3 to 4 L of oxygen .
Her heart rate was around 90 per minute , her blood pressure was 170/90 , and her respiratory rate was around 24 .
She appeared to be in mild to moderate respiratory distress at that time .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
HEENT - Pupils are equally reactive to light on both sides .
Extraocular movements are intact .
Neck supple .
Respiratory system - Reduced breath sounds in right lung base and now she has a few crackles on the right lung base few weak respiratory wheezes in both lung fields .
Abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended .
Extremities - No cyanosis , clubbing , or edema .
Skin - No rash .
Joints - No effusions .
CNS - Nonfocal at that time .
LABS :
Labs would be drawn STAT but at this time she did not have any labs and the last labs done were 36 hours ago .
The patient 's EKG per my interpretation does not show any acute changes and her troponins have been negative less than 0.10 .
Chest x-ray to my interpretation shows right - sided pleural effusion and __________ opacity on the right middle lobe .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
Mrs. **NAME[BBB AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female who was transferred from the Medical ICU and she was admitted on the floor for treatment of hospital - acquired pneumonia .
1. Hospital - acquired pneumonia .
At this time , continue Zosyn and vancomycin .
The patient had sputum cultures / tracheal aspirate done on **DATE[Nov 12] that showed multiple epithelial cells , moderate WBC s , however the cultures did not grow except for normal oropharyngeal flora .
At this time , we will continue Zosyn and vancomycin to continue the 14 - day course .
2. Respiratory distress .
At this time , I think the probable cause of her respiratory distress is either worsening pneumonia versus her right - sided pleural effusion .
The patient had an ABG done and it showed that her pH was 7.24 and her PCO2 was 68 , PaO2 was 96 , and bicarb was 28 .
At this time , I will give her 40 mg of IV Lasix and also some Duo Nebs .
The patient might need BiPAP since she is retaining CO2 .
The patient will be transferred to medical ICU for BiPAP and also for IV diuresis .
The patient may also need an echocardiogram to evaluate for LV function .
3. The patient has only one IV access and the patient is refusing blood work at this time .
We will start giving her FFP since her INR was 2.9 so that she can get a STAT central lumen catheter for blood work and IV antibiotics .
4. Continue the GI prophylaxis .
5. Will continue the psych consult at this time .
6. I discussed with Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] at the MICU and the patient was accepted by Dr. **NAME[SSS] .
The patient will be transferred to the MICU at this time .
I discussed with the doctors extensively and doctors agreed for all the intervention including IV antibiotics , BiPAP , anti __________ agent , inotropic agent , and defibrillation , however they said the patient would be
DNI , no intubation and no ventilation , however they want everything else done for the patient except for intubation and ventilation .
At this time , the patient is only DNI .
The total time spent on the patient was at least 1 hour 30 minutes .

HISTORY :
Patient is a 73-year-old retired cook with a history of cervical myelopathy , who is admitted for new left hemiparesis .
He had undergone C-spine surgery for spinal stenosis with a question of myelopathy and radiculopathy in 1992 with residual spastic paresis and monoparesis of the left upper extremity , but was ambulatory until a day prior to admission .
At his baseline , he was able to perform limited tasks with his left upper extremity , and was clearly able to move his hand and able to ambulate .
He also at baseline has had urinary and fecal urgencies / incontinence .
His history is now that he has had a week of progressive left upper extremity weakness , to the point of being unable to move the left hand and one day of being unable to walk secondary to left leg weakness with a marked tendency to fall leftward .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for anemia , hypercholesterolemia , narcolepsy for the past 6 years on Dexedrine , impotence with decreased testosterone , status post implant , peptic ulcer disease , status post duodenal resection , cervical stenosis , status post decompression &apos;92 , hernia , status post herniorrhaphy .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , older , black gentleman in no acute distress with left upper extremity flex across his chest .
His temperatureis 98.9 .
His pressure is 150/90 .
Rate 76 .
Respirations 16 .
He was edentulous .
He had mild copper wiring .
He has a I / VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border .
Heart sounds were normal and regular .
Breath sounds were equal bilaterally with course rhonchi .
He had a midline abdominal scar and a reducible umbilical hernia .
Abdomen was otherwise soft and nontender .
He had 2+ carotids , no bruits .
He had gynecomastia .
Rectal was guaiac negative with brown stool , good tone but unable to squeeze .
Extremities :
1+ right posterior tibialis , 2+ left posterior tibialis , no edema , ichthyotic changes were present .
He had 0 left wrist flexion or extension while his left proximal muscles were 4 including his biceps and triceps .
His right arm muscles were also in the range of 4/5.
His hip flexion was 4+ on the right and 4- on the left ; extension 5 on the right , 4+ on the left ; knee flexion evidently trace on the right and 4- on the left with knee extension 5- on the left , 5 on the right ; knee flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right ; ankle dorsi flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right .
Reflexes 4+ overall in the upper extremities and 3+ overall in the lower extremities , an upgoing left toe and a down going right toe .
His tone was increased on the left side and he had diminished pin prick and light touch in his left upper extremity and slightly in his left lower extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern .
He occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating .
Mental state :
He was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital and the date .
He was mildly perseverative and inattentive .
Coordination :
his fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits .
He was unable to stand without extensive assistance .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 .
Chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease .
On the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , no ST or T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .
He underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .
However , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .
He had normal cervical vertebral arteries .
Transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .
The proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .
Over the course of the first hospital day , the patient &apos;s exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .
He had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .
A computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .
MRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .
Because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .
His systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .
However , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .
This strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .
While in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .
He also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .
In terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .
He was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .
I should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .
He had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .
Additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .
He was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .
At this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .
We anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .
He will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po qd , Omeprazole 20mg po qd , Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid , Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic , Tylenol 650 mg po q4 prn , Colace 100 mg po bid .
Follow up will be with Dr. Tvi Fine of Neurology , and Dr. Doll Grendbly of internal medicine and primary care , shortly after discharge from rehab .

BLUE GENERAL SURGERY
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Gonzalez is a patient with a prior medical history including hypothyroidism , iron-deficiency anemia , osteoporosis , increased cholesterol , peptic ulcer disease , chronic constipation , and status post appendectomy as well as status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
She was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation and treatment of adenocarcinoma involving the transverse colon and gallbladder .
At the outside hospital the patient had already seemed some workup for a couple weeks duration of bilateral upper quadrant pain which occasionally radiated to her back .
She was also complaining of fatigue for two weeks but a good appetite and the patient denied weight loss , melena , or bright red blood per rectum .
A CAT scan of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels in the gallbladder .
It also showed a thickened gallbladder wall as well as a dilated common bile duct .
Incidentally , it also showed diverticulosis .
A HIDA scan at the other hospital did not show filling of the gallbladder indicating some sort of
cystic duct obstruction .
The first imaging study that was done at Hahnemann General Hospital was a MRCP which revealed an enhanced thickened gallbladder wall consistent with chronic cholecystitis .
A differential according to the imaging included a fistula with adjacent inflammatory change but also carcinoma or adenomatosis .
In addition, also the MRCP showed a mass near the region of the neck of the gallbladder .
Of note , at the outside hospital , an endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed .
The colonoscopy showed two polyps and also a region in the transverse colon that was biopsied .
This biopsy came back as positive for adenocarcinoma .
The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was already established prior to her admission at this hospital .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was scheduled for an operative date on 2014-07-29 and over the next few days she was
given a low-residual diet .
She had her belly cleaned with Hibiclens one a day and once an adequate preoperative evaluation was performed , she was given a bowel prep on Monday afternoon and evening in preparation for an
exploratory laparotomy on Tuesday , 2014-07-29 .
On the morning of 2014-07-29 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a cholecystectomy , partial hepatectomy , partial lymph node dissection , a colocolostomy , partial colectomy , and in addition a gastrostomy and a feeding jejunostomy were also put in place .
Please refer to the previously dictated operative notes for the details of this surgery .
Briefly , the surgery on 2014-07-29 revealed a carcinoma of the gallbladder with a cholecystocolonic fistula which crossed into the liver as well as metastatic adenopathy around the portal nodes as well as retroperitoneal nodes around the inferior vena cava and the hepatic artery .
In addition to the gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tube , two Belmont-Gardner drains were placed .
The patient 's pain postoperatively was controlled with an epidural catheter .
However , the epidural had the consequence of causing a bit of a hypotension in the patient and the patient was admitted to the Surgical ICU for the first postoperative day .
In addition , the patient had low hematocrits which required a transfusion of packed red blood cells .
In addition , on postoperative day number two , the patient was transferred out to the floor and she was doing better in terms of pain control on a Dilaudid PCA machine .
On postoperative day number two , interestingly , the patient was complaining of sensitivity to light from an unknown etiology .
The patient 's postoperative course was unremarkable aside from the photophobia .
On postoperative day number two , an Oncology consult with Dr. Natalie Mcalister was obtained and
follow-up appointments were scheduled with him as an outpatient .
Following that , the patient was slowly advanced to clear liquids and to a regular diet once her bowels began working when she began having flatus .
Her bowel function was slow to develop and she needed to remain n.p.o. until postoperative day number six .
The patient was also given supplemental tube feedings to supplement her calories and caloric intake .
On postoperative day number seven , the patient was tolerating her clear liquid diet and her tube feeds .
She was started on p.o. medicines and her first Belmont-Gardner drain was pulled due to scant output .
By 2014-08-09 , the patient was tolerating a full solid diet as well as her tube feeds .
Between the two of those , her caloric intake was sufficient for her to sustain herself .
She was discharged to home with services including tube feedings for her home care .
Therefore , she was discharged on 2014-08-09 in good condition .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Metastatic gallbladder cancer .
2. Status post cholecystectomy .
3. Status post transverse colectomy with anastomosis .
4. G tube placement .
5. Feeding jejunostomy .
6. Hypothyroidism .
7. Blood loss requiring transfusion .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Levothyroxine 100 micrograms orally once a day .
2. Pantoprazole one tablet once a day .
3. Ambien 10 mg orally before bed .
4. Tylenol # 3 one tablet every four hours as needed for pain .
5. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at bedtime .
6. Colace 100 mg twice a day .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
Follow-up with the Visiting Nurses Association to arrange assistance with her tube feeding and
her activities of daily living .
The patient is also scheduled for an appointment with Dr. Patterson approximately two weeks after her discharge from the hospital .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. Mass was a 56 year old white male who was transferred from Vassdiysey Medical Center for rule out pancreatic pseudocyst .
Mr. Mass had a past medical history which included Wegener &apos;s granulomatosis , history of an anterior myocardial infarction , and gallstone pancreatitis .
He was admitted to Vassdiysey Medical Center with severe recurrent pancreatitis , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain .
His amylase on admission there was 1,961 .
The patient had two recent admissions for pancreatitis in January 1994 , and August 1994 .
On his current admission , the patient was admitted to Free Medical Center .
His amylase decreased to 51 , and the increased back to 151 on hospital day #10 .
At that time , he spiked a temperature to 103 .
He also became increasingly confused .
A computerized tomography scan done on 4/16/95 showed a large &quot; pseudocyst &quot; .
He was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center for further surgical evaluation .&apos;

Cor :
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no extra heart sounds , abdomen distended with an epigastric mass noted , mildly tender to palpation , no guarding .
Bowel sounds were present .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count was 14.4 , hematocrit was 36.2 , platelet count was 217 , sodium was 135 , potassium was 3.3 , chloride was 99 , bicarbonate was 25 , BUN was 40 , creatinine was 1.9 , glucose was 124 , urinalysis was negative , PT was 12.2 , PTT was 24.5 , calcium was 7.8 , phosphorus was 3.7 , albumin was 2.3 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , alkaline phosphatase was 202 , SGPT was 32 , SGOT was 64 , LDH was 998 , amylase was 150 .
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 107 beats per minute .
Evidence of old left anterior septal infarct .
Chest X-ray :
Large left ventricle , bilateral atelectasis or effusion .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan :
Pancreatitis , fluid collection in the lesser sac .
A perisplenic effusion was noted which appeared to communicate with the lesser sac collection .
Gallbladder was visualized with stones .
IN SUMMARY , the patient was considered to have severe necrotizing pancreatitis , with severe cardiac disease .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .
He was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
On 4/17/95 , GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
An echocardiogram was done .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
The fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .
On 4/28/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on 4/27 .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
Approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .
The computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .
Because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95 .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
Drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .
He remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .
Thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .
Mr. Mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 .
The patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew Candida albicans .
The patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
Mr. Mass was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .
He remained stable from a cardiac fashion .
He did have problems with po intake .
He had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .
He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
By the end of June , it became clear that Mr. Mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .
The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .
Multiple discussions were held between Dr. Mass , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient &apos;s wife , with this same result .
After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. Douet at Vassdiysey Medical Center , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to Vassdiysey Medical Center .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .

Condition C was called in 12 - D .
On my arrival , I found that this patient was unresponsive .
On reviewing the chart and talking to the nurse , I found that the patient was a **AGE[in 30s]- year - old gentleman with sickle cell anemia who had come into the hospital earlier yesterday for what was diagnosed to be acute sickle cell crisis and pain .
He has a past history of chronic renal insufficiency and gout , also .
The patient 's nurse was apparently in the patient 's room at the bedside .
The patient was initially on 2 liters nasal cannula according to the patient 's nurse , however , sats were 88% , so she increased the nasal cannula to 4 liters .
While his vitals were being taken , the patient complained of acute shortness of breath and inability to breathe .
The patient 's nurse placed the patient on face mask oxygen , called Respiratory Therapy , and the primary internal medicine I Service attending , however , the patient acutely became unresponsive , and hence a Condition C was called immediately .
On my arrival , I found the I Service attending at the bedside .
The patient had what looked like sinus rhythm on the morning which looked bradycardic .
The patient was pale and was having agonal respirations .
I immediately assisted the patient with bag - mask ventilation and oral airway .
The patient did not have an IV access .
I immediately started to place an emergent left femoral venous catheter and got ready for intubation .
After one esophageal intubation attempt , mainly because of inability to see the course because of massive secretions , I was successfully able to intubate the patient in the larynx .
Soon after intubation , the patient lost his pulse and blood pressure .
We initiated CPR .
I gave the patient multiple rounds of epinephrine , atropine , calcium , bicarbonate , placed a central line , and volume resuscitated the patient .
Despite bag - mask ventilation and all the above maneuvers , the patient was refractory .
He persisted in an agonal rhythm with very intermittent very feeble pulses and subsequently remained in
PEA with agonal rhythm after 20 - 30 minutes of resuscitation process .
I subsequently called off the code and declared the patient dead .
The I Service attending was present at the bedside , and he was going to talk to the patient 's family and inform them .
In listening to the nurse , it sounds like this was an acute witnessed unresponsive episode of the patient .
It is possible that the patient had a massive PE .
The event sounds predominantly respiratory since the patient complained of acute shortness of breath and just became unresponsive right after that .
He had good bilateral breath sounds .
I did not think the patient had any reason to have a pneumothorax .
The total critical care time I provided on this patient is **AGE[in 30s] minutes including CPR time .

Brief Hospital Course :
Pt is a 78 yo male with atrial fibrillation , s/p multiple CVA s, CHF , HTN , DM2 transferred from the CMED CCU s/p intervention for cholangitis .
1) Acute cholangitis : Pt was admitted to the ICU , intubated , and ERCP performed , likely stone obstructing CBD .
Stent was placed and patient was treated with antibiotics ( Zosyn - > Ciprofloxacin ).
Per ERCP fellow , plan is for patient to return in four weeks to see Dr. Suzanne Davis , at which time he will likely have repeat cholangiogram and removal of stent and stone .
If this is still problematic , pt may also need a sphincterotomy .
Dr.Demby secretary will contact patient at home the week after discharge to schedule this for the end of January .
Pt is to continue ciprofloxacin for a complete 14 day course .
2) Mechanical mitral valve : Anticoagulation was reversed for ERCP .
After this he was anticoagulated with heparin drip .
INR was 1.9 on discharge .
He was given sc lovenox x 1 and will continue this the day after discharge bid for one day .
VNA will check his INR at home and page his PCP with the results .
3) Atrial fibrillation : Rate controlled and on warfarin .
While in the hospital he had several episodes of pauses , none longer than 2.5 seconds .
His digoxin was held and his metoprolol was titrated down from his home dose .
Once the digoxin was no longer having effect , metoprolol was titrated back to home dose .
4) CHF : Pt was oxygen dependent for most of the hospital course , CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema .
He was diuresed with lasix with good effect .
Volume overload likely ocurred in the setting of IV fluids given in the ICU .
Did not require lasix on discharge .
5) E. coli bacteremia / sepsis : Source of acute cholangitis as above .
Pt required 3 day stay in the surgical ICU and intubation as above .
6) Intubation : Pt was 97% on room air on arrival to Cindy , developed rapid ventricular reponse to a fib which was treated , but after that period of time required oxygen , presumably for pulmonary edema .
In the Lori pt was given 3L NS as well as 1 unit of FFP , and oxygen requirements contimued to climb .
In the CMED CCU pt was intubated for ERCP procedure .
He was extubated the next morning .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 54 year-old female with a history of breast cancer with known brain mets , history of PE , recent radiation therapy and steroids who presented in 2012-04-23 with myopathy presumed secondary to sterids , which have been given for her brain mets .
She was later sent to rehab , but returned early in April with increased cough with exertion with fever to 101 .
She was treated with Levaquin given her temperatures and differential diagnosis of increased PE burden load , infections or pneumonia and questionable lymphangitic spread of her cancer .
The patient did not experience improvement in her symptoms and was readmitted on 06-11 with continued dyspnea and fevers .
Review of CTA showed no PE , but there was ground glass opacities on CT , so PCP was considered highly unlikely given her recent history of steroid use .
Her induced sputum was negative and BOL was done and also negative .
Sputum cultures were negative .
She was given Bactrim and she had improvement in the shortness of breath after her Bactrim was started and improved room air sats and was sent home on Bactrim .
She then continued to do poorly and then returned on 06-19 .
She presented on clinic on 06-20 with hypotension for which she was given intravenous fluids .
She spiked a fever to 103 with blood pressures hypertensive into the systolic 80 s and with rigors .
Chest x-ray showed a question of left lung opacity .
The patient was given Vancomycin and a gram of intravenous fluids .
Today , the patient was found in the bathroom and became hypoxic with saturations in the 80 s and was responsive to oxygen , but was still tachypneic without improvement and was placed on nonrebreather .
Currently the patient is admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further medical care .
Currently the patient is short of breath without chest pain or dysphagia .

SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is an emergency room physician at the Pauline .
She is married with three children .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On examination on transfer to the Intensive Care Unit she is febrile with a low grade temperature of 100.1 , tachycardic to 110 , hypotensive 85/49 , tachypneic into the 50 s and 60 s, 95% on nonrebreather .
In general , she is extremely tachypneic , difficulty in speaking words .
Her heart is regular without murmurs , rubs or gallops , slightly tachycardic .
Her pulmonary examination shows she has bronchial breath sounds with dry crackles at the bases .
Abdominal examination was benign .
Extremities no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
She is alert and following commands .
LABORATORY :
White blood cell count 3.2 , hematocrit 26.6 , platelets 130 , chemistry is 131 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 105 , bicarb 17 , BUN 10 , creatinine 0.5 , glucose 105 .
Calcium 7.3 , phos 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 .
She had a gas showing 7.36 , 31 , 96 .
She had a CT from the 29th of her abdomen and pelvis showing marked increased consolidations at the left lung base and question of new left sided pleural effusion .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Pulmonary :
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory distress and febrile hypotension with a question of a new infiltrate on her chest x-ray .
The exact etiology of the patient 's respiratory distress was presumed to be questionable multifactorial .
There was concern about possible pneumonia .
Also she had a history of PE and also there was concern about possible lymphangitic spread of her breast CA .
Given her fevers and shortness of breath the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics initially started on Ceptaz , Levaquin and __________ and Clindamycin .
Lab two antibiotics were added considering the patient was thought to be a relatively high risk for PCP Douglas .
The patient was initially trialed on BiPAP , but the patient was increasingly dyspneic , increased respiratory stress and ultimately needed to be intubated on 06-22 .
Earlier during her Intensive Care Unit course she underwent bronchoscopy , which was sent for cytology and multiple bacterial pathogens all of which were negative .
Ultimately her Intensive Care Unit course continued and she began to defervesce and her bacterial studies particulaly from BAL lavage were found to be negative .
The patient had multiple antibiotics withdrawn .
Clindamycin and _______________ was discontinued early in hospital course .
Her PCP was thought to be negative .
In addition , Vancomycin , Levaquin were also discontinued .
She was later continued on Ceftazidine and Clindamycin for possible gram negative infection and also for possible post obstructive picture that she would be at risk for given her pulmonary anatomy .
As the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course went on the patient 's respiratory did not show mild improvement on the ventilator .
She was able to oxygenate originally .
Unfortunately her mental status failed to improve despite having been off all sedative medications for several days .
Later in her Intensive Care Unit course family meetings took place and given the patient 's overall poor prognosis with decreased mental status it was decided that the patient would become CMO .
Subsequently she was extubated on 06-28 .
The patient continues to actually ventilate well off of the respiratory .
However , she is CMO and will not be intubated for respiratory distress .
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient was initially transferred to the Intensive Care Unit thought to be exhibiting septic physiology , respiratory distress and hypotensive .
She required aggressive intravenous fluids and later required pressor support with neo-synephrine .
Later during her Intensive Care Unit course she was felt to be somewhat overloaded and intravenous fluids were cut back .
It was quite difficult weaning her off of neo-synephrine .
She was also given stress dose steroids .
Later in her hospital course she also had an echocardiogram for question of new ECG findings in her inferior leads .
Her echocardiogram , however , was essentially normal with an ejection fraction of 55% without any gross wall motion abnormalities or valvular pathology .
As mentioned above the patient 's hemodynamic status was tenuous throughout her hospital course as it was difficult to wean the patient off of neo-synephrine .
By 06-28 , however , the patient had been off of neo-synephrine , but at this time as mentioned above the patient was deemed to be CMO per discussion with physicians and her husband / health care proxy .
3. Hematology :
Patient with a history of known malignancy and also a history of pulmonary embolisms from 2012-04-23 .
Earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course the team was concerned about possible pulmonary embolisms as a possible source of the patient 's respiratory decompensation .
However , the patient also had brain metastasis and at this point anticoagulation was thought to be a contraindication given risk for hemorrhage into these tumors .
She did have lower extremity doppler ultrasounds , which were negative .
4. Infectious disease :
As mentioned above patient initially hypotension , febrile and in respiratory distress presumed to be septic source likely pulmonary .
Initially the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin , Ceptaz , Levaquin , Clindamycin and _________.
All of her cultures are negative to date .
She was negative for PCP and subsequently _____________ was continued and Clindamycin was changed for anaerobic coverage .
In addition her Vancomycin and Levaquin were also discontinued .
The patient remained afebrile during the majority of her hospital course .
By virtue of discussions on 06-28 the patient was deemed to be CMO and all antibiotics were withdrawn at this point .
5. Gastroenterology :
The patient had an abdominal CT earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course , which was essentially negative for an intraabdominal pathology .
She was initially supported with tube feeds during her Intensive Care Unit course , but at this point the patient is CMO and tube feeds have been subsequently discontinued .
DISPOSITION :
The patient 's attending physician was in constant communication with the patient 's health care proxy her husband .
As her Intensive Care Unit course continued and the patient showed minimal signs of meaningful improvement , continued discussions were had with the family about possibly changing code status .
Ultimately it was decided by 06-28 that the patient had shown minimal improvement and minimal evidence of improvement status , it was decided at this point for the patient to be extubated and to move toward CMO care .
Subsequently all antibiotics , blood draws and supportive blood pressure medications were withdrawn .
Currently she is comfortable with morphine and Ativan prn.
Currently plans are in the making for arranging for the patient to have home hospice care .
Please see discharge addendum for further developments in the patient 's care .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 23 07]
I am managing this critically ill , **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male who is postoperative day #4 from repair of SMA pseudoaneurysm .
Postoperative course complicated by fluid overload , respiratory insufficiency and jaundice .
I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the General and Vascular surgeons .
PROBLEMS AND MANAGEMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS :
1. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and infiltrates .
On the vent , I have him on assist control .
His peak airway pressures , minute ventilation and gas exchange have been adequate .
I did place him on a pressure support trial today and after a two-hour trial , his rapid shallow breathing index was less than 100 .
I have weaned and extubated him .
I have also given him a couple doses of Lasix today which he has responded with a brisk diuresis .
Clinically he is improving with the diuresis and will continue to diurese him over the course of the evening .
2. Status post SMA aneurysm repair .
He remains on prophylactic antibiotics .
I have increased his dose of labetalol for better blood pressure and heart rate control and he seems to be responding nicely to that .
His abdominal distention has improved significantly as has his tenderness .
I will start some trickle tube feeds with Peptinex today .
Of note , his total bilirubin is up to 10 today .
His transaminases are unremarkable .
Previously , his bilirubin was around 5 to 6 .
I suspect that he just has some increasing cholestasis after the surgery .
We have ordered a right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate .
Total Critical Care time = 40 minutes .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
GI bleed .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Stable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient &apos;s hospital course is as follows :
Patient is an 84-year-old male who was transferred from an outside hospital with a low hematocrit of 21 and with guaiac-positive stool .
The day prior to admission , he experienced dyspnea on exertion , and on the day of admission he collapsed and complained of substantial weakness .
He denied any melana , any hematemesis , nausea or vomiting .
He was taken to an outside hospital at the time at which time it was found that his hematocrit was 21 , blood pressure 90/60 , and his INR was 3.3 .
Of note , he is anti-coagulated for an artificial heart valve .
He was at that point given 1 unit of packed red blood cells .
On further questioning , the patient reported that he started to feel &quot; different &quot; several days ago with slowing and difficult ambulation progressing to complete inability to ambulate .
He was also short of breath with ambulation , but he does have baseline shortness of breath with exertion .
He denied any chest pain , dysuria , loss of consciousness , fevers , chills or any history of myocardial infarction .
Patient was last admitted to Padrugmoff Hospital with a hematocrit of 24.5 , and was asymptomatic prior to admission .
At that time , he had guaiac-positive and had a small bowel follow through which was negative .
He was transfused 4 units during that admission and discharged with a hematocrit of 34 on vitamin C and iron sulfate .
EXAM ON ARRIVAL IN THE LO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM :
On arrival at the Lo Hospital Emergency Room :
He was found to have a temperature of 97.4 , heart rate 65 , pressure 107/52 , respiratory rate 22 and saturating 100% on 2 L of a nasal cannula .
General exam at the time was notable for pale mucous membranes , left lateral eye deviation , clear lungs , 2/6 holosystolic murmur , best heard at the apex , abdomen was mildly distended but was soft and nontender and his extremities were without edema and skin without any rashes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is as follows :
History of coronary artery disease with status post two-vessel CABG in 1986 , also he was treated for congestive heart failure , hypertension , aortic valve replacement , and mitral valve replacement with St. Jude &apos;s valve in 09/2001 , atrial fibrillation , history of prior GI bleed requiring blood transfusions during which he also had a colonoscopy on 05/2003 which demonstrated no neoplasia and scattered diverticuli .
The patient also , following his first GI bleed , had an EEG done in 07/2003 which showed gastritis with oozing and evidence of a recent bleed .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS :
Included Lasix , Lopressor , Coumadin , Diovan , torsemide , Flomax , Protonix , Senekot , potassium , vitamin C , iron , and a multivitamin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Notable for no tobacco , no alcohol .
He has a wife with Alzheimer &apos;s who lives in a skilled-nursing facility .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a BUN and creatinine of 78 , 1.7 ; for a sodium , potassium 139 and 3.6 ; chloride and bicarb 108 , 21 .
White count 7 , hematocrit 24.2 , platelet count was 183 .
His INR was also 3.4 .
PTT was 55 .
His EKG was notable for right bundle branch block , left axis deviation , but was in sinus rhythm .
His UA had 10-17 white blood cells ; trace leukocyte esterase hyaline casts numbering 60-70 .
His chest x-ray was notable for clear lungs with no edema or infiltrates and small bilateral effusions .
OTHER NOTALBE LABS :
Patient was found to have a troponin of 0.71 on admission with a CK of 46 and CKMB of 3.4 .
ASSESSMENT :
At that time , it was felt that the patient was likely having a repeat GI bleed and while he was hemodynamically stable , he had evidently lost a substantial amount of blood .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. GI :
Patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission .
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C .
His Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the Coumadin .
He was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following :
In the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous .
A small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an Endoclip was applied to this .
Another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .
In the duodenum , a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized .
The biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia .
Also of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .
Patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge .
His last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 .
His last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 .
Consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy .
This was discussed with the GI Service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in 05/2003 .
2. Cardiovascular :
A :
Ischemia :
Patient &apos;s troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his GI bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome .
On discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his Lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted .
B :
Rhythm :
Patient continued to be in A-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his Coumadin concurrently with heparin .
Heparin was subsequently DCd once his INR reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 .
His last reported INR on discharge was 2.5 .
C :
Valves :
Patient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .
However , his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge .
D :
Pump :
Patient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .
He was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix .
He subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .
Of note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission .
DISPOSITION :
Was discharged on 11/16/2003 in stable condition with the last recorded hematocrit of 31.3 .
He was asked to continue on his Nexium , iron and vitamin C and was continued on his other home medications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
His final medications on discharge were as follows :
Aspirin 325 , he was restarted on a PPI , also on iron , vitamin C , Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d .
Of note , this was at a decreased dose compared to that which he came in on , Coumadin 7.5 , mg , torsemide 100 q.d. , sucralfate , simvastatin , Diovan .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with his PCP as well as to follow up with the Anticoagulation Clinic and Dr. Gilbert .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 24 07]
I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male status post repair of an SMA false aneurysm .
Hospital course has been complicated by malnutrition , respiratory insufficiency , fluid overload , and postoperative cholestasis .
I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and Emtek data , and discussed the management with the vascular and general surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory insufficiency .
Chest x-ray continues to show pulmonary vascular congestion .
I have given him another 20 mg of Lasix today .
Clinically , his respiratory pattern is improved and I am weaning his oxygen down .
He is diuresing nicely with Lasix and we will keep him the intensive care unit for pulmonary toileting .
2. Status post SMA repair .
We will continue a five - day course of Cipro , Flagyl , and vancomycin empirically .
Hemoglobin and hematocrit have been stable .
I have discontinued the q.6 hourly hematocrit checks .
He does have a little bit of what I think is postoperative cholestasis with an increase in his total bilirubin from a preoperative level of 6 to a postoperative level of 10 .
We will check that on a daily basis .
Right upper quadrant shows no signs of ductal dilatation .
Gastroenterology is following closely .
3. Malnutrition .
I have started him back up on his TPN .
He did not do well on trickle tube feeds last night and had an episode of vomiting , and I have discontinued his tube feeding .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Cardiac arrest .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old man who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit status post cardiac arrest .
History was obtained per the Emergency Department report as well as from the patient 's family .
Information was very limited regarding the circumstances of his cardiac arrest .
Reportedly , the patient was at a local restaurant where he was noted to be unresponsive .
EMS was called and reported to arrive on scene within three minutes .
The patient was asystolic but regained a perfusing rhythm after 2 mg of Epinephrine and 2 mg of Atropine .
He was intubated in the field and brought to the Emergency Department .
He remained unresponsive despite the administration of Narcan .
CT examinations of the head , chest , abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable .
Initial chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent interstitium though his lung volumes were low .
Subsequent chest x-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the endotracheal tube .
The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for induced hypothermia given his hemodynamic stability , ongoing unresponsiveness and recent out of hospital cardiac arrest .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Hypertension .
2) Chronic low back pain , s/p lumbar discectomy x 2 .
3) Cirrhosis .
4) h/o stab wound complicated by pneumothorax .
5) h/o lower extremity cellulitis .
6) s/p cholecystectomy .
7) Peripheral neuropathy .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
According to his pharmacy , he was on :
1. OxyContin 40 mg p.o. q 12hours .
2. Percocet .
3. Nortriptyline .
4. Neurontin 1800 mg four times a day
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is divorced .
His son is a policeman working in Ludlow .
He drinks greater than one case of beer per day .
He has a history of abuse of Percocet according to his brother .
James is currently homeless .
He was recently arrested for altering a prescription according to his pharmacy .
He had recently filled a prescription for 560 tablets of Percocet as well as 60 tablets of OxyContin early last month .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative for any history of sudden death or coronary artery disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , temperature was 96.2 , blood pressure 150/80 , heart rate 92 , respiratory rate 16 .
In general , he was unarousible , intubated , not on any sedation .
Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat - His pupils were equal and three millimeters .
They were minimally reactive .
His sclerae were anicteric .
The cardiac examination was unremarkable without murmurs .
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
His abdomen had normal bowel sounds , soft and nontender .
Extremities had multiple bilateral lower extremity excoriations .
Neurologic examination - he was unarousible and without sedation .
He had no spontaneous movements .
Flaccid .
Extremities - Babinski reflex was equivocal bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
At the time of admission , laboratories were remarkable for a partial thromboplastin time of 31.7 , INR 1.4 , potassium 3.2 , glucose 182 , lactate was initially 6.6 .
Urine toxicology screen was negative .
Serum toxicology screen was positive for TCA s.
Tylenol level was 15 .
Alcohol level was 199 .
Initial blood gas was 7.31/46/500/77 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac arrest - His arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission .
No further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization .
CT angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism .
The patient had an echocardiogram on 2013-04-26 , which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation ; otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen .
Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest , remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability , he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours .
This was done , however , as in problem number two below , we were not successful in any neurologic recovery .
Neurology - The patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia , the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids .
Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity .
Neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively , loaded with multiple drugs , including Ativan and Propofol drips .
The patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this .
He was loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb coma .
After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb , the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed .
Infectious disease - Over the course of his hospital stay , the patient 's white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17 .
Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia , pneumonia , and urinary tract infection .
For all these infections , the patient was treated with Vancomycin and he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission .
Blood cultures cleared by 2013-05-03 .
Sputum culture as late as 2013-05-10 , however was still positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
The patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of kin .
Ultimately it was decided that the patient 's wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only .
With these goals of care , the patient expired on 2013-05-11 .
The family did consent to a postmortem examination .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
Cardiac arrest .
Anoxic brain injury
Status epilepticus
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia .
MRSA urinary tract infection .
MRSA Bacteremia .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
1 ) THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA .
2 ) BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS ORGANIZING PNEUMONIA .
3 ) RENAL FAILURE REQUIRING CHRONIC DIALYSIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
On May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .
She was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .
On May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .
Her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .
Chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .
A VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .
On May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .
At this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
She was started on a steroid trial at that point .
Her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .
On June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .
The patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .
From May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .
On June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1 ) Cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .
2 ) Hypertension .
3 ) Status post hysterectomy .
4 ) Status post appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
1 ) Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.
2 ) Lasix p.r.n.
3 ) Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day .
4 ) Inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d.
5 ) Thiamine .
6 ) Lasix p.r.n.
7 ) Atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.
8 ) Folic acid .
9 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day .
10 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day .
11 ) Insulin sliding scale .
ALLERGIES :
The patient had no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is divorced .
She has two children .
She recently retired as a clerical worker .
She denies any tobacco .
She has only social alcohol use .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .
Mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .
Brother has coronary artery disease .
There is no family history of hematologic problems .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , BUN 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :
The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .
This was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .
By discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .
The patient &apos;s bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .
Repeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient &apos;s pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .
At the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .
2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :
The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .
This was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1999 .
She was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .
Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .
Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .
She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .
The patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .
Eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .
After this , the patient &apos;s platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .
It is felt that the patient &apos;s thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .
She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .
3 ) Renal :
The patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .
Throughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .
The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .
She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .
During the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .
4 ) Infectious disease :
The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .
The patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .
She received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .
In addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .
She also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .
She was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .
The patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .
5 ) Rheumatology :
The patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
Unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .
A repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .
FOLLOW-UP :
1 ) The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Tamarg Study , in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .
2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
The nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study .
3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .
4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .
The left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .
She would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .
5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .
6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on July 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary .
7 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Cedwi Stone at 336-2931 on August 30 , 1999 at 1:40 PM .
8 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm at the We Erthunt Hospital at 180-0455 on August 15 , 1999 at 12:30 PM .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 61 - year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 2009-09-11 , who presents for elective right heart catheterization and pericardiocentesis .
The patient did well after his coronary artery bypass graft .
On 10-14 , the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a new , moderate-to-large sized pericardial effusion .
The patient was asymptomatic at this time , and the decision was made to monitor him and to start him on Lasix .
The patient had follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram on 11-04 which revealed a slightly large effusion .
A few days later , on 11-07 , the patient began to develop dyspnea on exertion with normal activity .
He also noted a new two to three-pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
On 11-08 , he had an episode of acute shortness of breath with chest pressure which he describes as different from his typical angina with minimal exertion .
The patient spoke with his cardiologist who referred him for pericardiocentesis for persistent and symptomatic pericardial effusion .
On right heart catheterization , the patient was noted to have elevated right-sided and left-sided filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 and a right atrial pressure of 16 .
After 600 cc of serosanguineous pericardial fluid was removed , the patient was noted to have a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 9 and a right atrial pressure of 2 ; indicating resolution of tamponade physiology .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Coronary artery disease , status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 2009-09-11 .
Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery to diagonal , saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal .

He had a blood pressure of 148 to 162/45 to 54 .
He had a heart rate of 85 to 87 , breathing at 17 to 23 , satting 100% on room air .
In general , he was alert and in no acute distress .
His neck was supple without any jugular venous distention .
HEENT examination revealed his pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light .
His extraocular movements were intact .
His sclerae were anicteric .
His mucous membranes were moist .
His oropharynx was benign .
Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and rhythm , heart sounds muffled , no murmurs .
Respiratory revealed bibasilar rales .
Abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended , positive bowel sounds .
Extremities revealed trace lower extremity edema , right greater than left , 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses .
He had 2+ femoral pulses bilaterally .
No hematomas were noted , but a soft right femoral bruit was heard .
LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION :
The patient had a white blood cell count of 9.5 , a hematocrit of 34.5 , a platelet count of 194 .
His Chem-7 revealed sodium of 132 , potassium of 43 , chloride of 97 , bicarbonate of 28 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 1.3 , glucose of 220 .
He had an INR of 1.1 .
A calcium of 8.4 , phosphate of 2.5 , magnesium of 1.9 .
Pericardial fluid analysis was consistent with an exudative etiology .
RADIOLOGY / IMAGING :
The patient had an electrocardiogram with normal sinus rhythm at 70 , normal axis , normal intervals , low voltage in the limb leads .
Chest x-ray on admission revealed a large left pleural effusion .
The patient had an echocardiogram on 11-10 which revealed the following :
Global left ventricular systolic function appeared grossly preserved .
Due to technical quality a focal wall motion abnormality could not be fully excluded .
The aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened .
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened .
There was a large pericardial effusion ( up to greater than 6 cm wide anterior to the right ventricle ).
The right ventricle was compressed .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit after his therapeutic pericardiocentesis .
He was hemodynamically stable and without any complaints .
He was continued on his home cardiac regimen , but was started on indomethacin for post pericardiotomy syndrome .
Over the course of the night the patient drained an additional 400 cc of serosanguineous fluid from his pericardial drain pouch .
By the next morning , the degree of drainage had decreased considerably with only 60 cc drained over six hours .
The patient had a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram prior to drain removal which revealed the following :
A trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion one day post pericardiocentesis with no change from the study immediately post pericardiocentesis .
The pericardial drain was removed without any difficulty .
The pericardial fluid bag was removed without any difficulty with the decision to monitor the patient overnight and repeat the echocardiogram prior to discharge .
The patient had an enlarged left pleural effusion which was noted to layer on a lateral decubitus film .
We decided to perform a therapeutic thoracentesis .
The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion , and 1150 cc of fluid were drained .
A chest x-ray was obtained post thoracentesis which revealed a significant decrease in the size of the left pleural effusion .
No evidence of pneumothorax .
On the morning of admission the patient had a markedly improved lung examination with increased air movement in the left base .
He denied any shortness of breath and had oxygen saturations in the 90 s on room air .
He had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion .
The patient was without any complaints and remained stable .

Signed
DIS
Admission Date :
09/16/2000
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
11/03/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
RUPTURED PARATHYROID ADENOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Shuffa is a 73-year-old Portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via Med Flight to Verg Medical Center .
She arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm .
She initially presented to Brottlake Medical Center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids .
While she was in Brottlake Medical Center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ENT consult was obtained .
They attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway .
She was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest .
Given these findings , she underwent a CT scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus .
This raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to Verg Medical Center emergently .
At the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center , she underwent an emergent CT scan with IV contrast .
This revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm .
However , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma .
She was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service under the care of Dr. Sccrookes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Severe hypertension , angina , GERD , peptic ulcer disease , status post Billroth II , ovarian cancer , status post TAH-BSO in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection .
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION :
Celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; Xanax 0.5 mg tabs .
On transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus Unasyn and Tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is divorced and retired .
She lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is intubated .
VITAL SIGNS :
Temperature 98.6 , 66 .
Right arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and A-line was 151/61 .
Tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of PEEP , and 100% FiO2 , satting 100% .
GENERAL :
She was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities .
NECK :
Edematous .
Trachea was midline .
She had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck .
The superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts .
She had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region .
Her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis .
LUNGS :
She had bilateral expiratory wheezes .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with good bowel sounds .
It was nontender .
It was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant .
Both were easily reducible .
PULSE :
On the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .
Coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .
Her gas was 7.47/40/332 .
Electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .
CT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .
It was consistent with a hematoma .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .
This showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .
She was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .
The differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .
On 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .
A biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .
The operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .
There was no active bleeding at the time .
Over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .
She had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .
The ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .
Given these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .
The Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .
At this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .
Dr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .
She underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .
Her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .
This required a chest tube .
Her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .
It was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .
However , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .
She underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .
It turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .
In conclusion , by systems :
1. Neuro .
The patient became intermittently agitated .
We have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .
She responds well to this .
She speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .
She has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .
She has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .
2. Cardiac .
The patient &apos;s blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .
This is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .
For this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .
Her blood pressure responds well to this .
Otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .
The patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .
This has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .
Dr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .
The aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .
They elected not to inject it with thrombin .
They asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .
They have opted for conservative management given the size .
3. Respiratory .
At the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .
She seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .
Her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .
Her right lung field is clear .
Her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .
She will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .
We had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .
With the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .
Her oxygen saturation has always been good .
4. GI .
The patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .
This is her goal .
She tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .
Last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .
Stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .
These have all been negative .
We believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .
Since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .
She has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .
5. GU .
The patient has had hypernatremia .
She is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .
We believe her to still be total body overloaded .
Over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .
We also have been diuresing her with Bumex .
This seems to trend her sodium down .
This will need to be monitored closely .
Her BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .
6. Heme .
As stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .
She had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .
Before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .
She had no problems with this .
At the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .
I stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .
We have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .
Therefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .
She does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .
She has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .
7. ID .
At the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .
She is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .
Interestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .
This is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .
We do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .
She is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .
Her Foley was changed the day before discharge .
8. Tubes , lines , and drains .
The patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .
Her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .

Mr. **NAME[AAA] has done reasonably well overnight .
He is complaining of some thirst this morning and would like to eat .
He has had some nausea last night but no vomiting .
On exam , he is afebrile .
His vital signs are stable .
His abdominal distension is decreased .
He is breathing comfortably between 14 and 18 times a minute .
Oxygen saturations are in the mid 90 's on nasal cannula O2 .
Ins and outs are overall net negative after the diuretics that I gave him yesterday .
His laboratory examination is significant for a slight increase in his total bilirubin yesterday to 11 .
Bilirubin today is pending .
The surgeons are arranging for a contrast study through the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube to evaluate his jaundice .
His transaminases are unremarkable , as is his GGT and alkaline phosphatase .
Right upper quadrant ultrasound does not show any signs of ductal dilatation .
I suspect most likely diagnosis is cholestasis from the surgery but will continue to follow along closely .
He is diuresing nicely with Lasix and still has some vascular congestion on radiographs , as well as edema on exam , and I have given him some more Lasix today .
The patient should be stable for transfer to a monitored surgical bed today .

Lungs were clear bilaterally .
Heart is regular rate and rhythm , without murmur .
Abdomen is soft , nontender with a pulsatile mass in the epigastrium .
Extremities reveals a 2+ femoral and pedal pulses bilaterally .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Vascular Surgery Service as a same day admission , and taken to the operating room for an uncomplicated endovascular repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm , and Anurx modular bifurcated graft was placed , and both common femoral arteries were repaired in the usual fashion .
He had pulsatile pulse volume recordings , in both lower extremities , and both renal arteries were noted to be patent , as were both internal iliac arteries .
His angiogram in the operating room , revealed no evidence of an endo leak .
Postoperatively , his course was relatively uncomplicated .
He did have an episode of a prolonged sinus pause in the recovery room , which resulted in transient loss of consciousness .
He responded to a Neo-Synephrine bolus , and had no further complications from this standpoint .
Dr. Rosean Fletcher , of the Cardiology Department was consulted , and it was his opinion that the sinus pause was related to increased vagal tone postoperatively , perhaps secondary to the epidural , as well as the patient &apos;s Atenolol use .
His Atenolol was held , and he had no further pauses during his stay .
His postoperative CT scan showed no evidence of endo leak , or graft kinking .
He maintained good peripheral pulses and warm feet postoperatively .
However , he did develop significant ecchymosis in both groins , extending down into his scrotum .
There was no evidence of significant groin hematomas .
He tolerated a regular diet .
His pain was adequately controlled with oral medications .
Accordingly , the patient was discharged to home on postoperative day 2 .
He will be visited by LDAMC for blood pressure and incision checks .
He will follow up with Dr. Dye in the Clinic .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Dec 11 07]
I was called to see Mr. **NAME[AAA] emergently as part of a condition C response .
The condition C was called for hypertension , tachycardia , rigor , and dyspnea .
When I arrived , the patient was being attended to by the critical care fellow and ICU nurse and the patient 's bedside nursing staff as well as a surgery resident .
The patient 's blood pressure was 220/120 .
His pulse was 146 in what appeared to be sinus tachycardia .
His respiratory rate was 44 .
he was on a rebreather face mask at 15 liters and he was 100% saturated .
The patient was awake , alert , and oriented .
He denied pain or chills .
He had rigor of the upper extremities but not of the lower .
The patient denied pain or difficulty breathing .
He had no chest pain .
There was no cough .
On my examination , the patient was somewhat pale but his color was not cyanotic ; in fact , he was slightly pink .
He was not flushed .
There was no skin rash .
His neurologic exam was intact .
His lungs were clear bilaterally .
His heart rate was rapid and regular .
His abdomen was slightly distended and reported as not being different from previous .
It was nontender .
There was no rebound .
There were bowel sounds .
He had no peripheral edema and no acrocyanosis .
We checked the patient 's morning labs which had been drawn only several hours earlier and noted no significant abnormalities .
I did note that the white blood cell count had increased from roughly 3000 to roughly 5000 .
We drew a blood gas which was not abnormal , and I decided to treat the patient 's hypertension and tachycardia with Lopressor .
I dosed him 2.5 mg every 3 minutes or so , giving him ultimately a total dose of 25 mg .
With this intervention , the patient 's pulse decreased from 146 down to 115 .
His blood pressure decreased down to 142/80 .
His respiratory rate decreased from 46 to 30 and the patient said that he did feel more comfortable with his breathing after the infusion of these medicines .
The surgery resident ordered 4 grams of magnesium which was infused as well .
We were concerned that this may be a medication event; however , the patient has only received Dilaudid since midnight .
He has tolerated Dilaudid well in the past and this did not appear to be a histamine reaction in any case , so I discount this as a possibility .
I was able to rapidly wean the patient 's FiO2 down to 4 liters of nasal cannula with 100% saturation .
He had no pulmonary complaints , so I do not believe pulmonary embolus is a cause .
It appears rather that this was some sort of catecholamine storm .
I am unclear as to the etiology but my best suspicion is that he may be having incipient sepsis .
His temperature is 38.5 .
There has been a bump in his white count and this occurred about an hour or so after having his biliary duct catheter flushed .
I spoke to the surgery fellow and we agreed to resume treatment with antibiotics .
I have asked for either Zosyn or Unasyn along with Flagyl , treating abdominal pathogens as well as C. difficile .
The patient has been complaining of diarrhea .
A CT scan has also been ordered by us , looking for an abdominal fluid collection which , if found , should be tapped .
I have moved the patient to the Intensive Care Unit because of his vital sign abnormalities and because it is unclear to me what the etiology of such a severe vital sign derangement is .
A chest x-ray has been ordered and has only just been taken ; I will check that .
I personally assisted transporting the patient to the 6G Intensive Care Unit and making sure he was stabilized there prior to leaving .
The total time taken in the care of this critically ill patient was 75 minutes .

Service :
CCU
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Acute inferior myocardial infarction and right ventricular infarction .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 61 - year-old Caucasian-speaking woman with a history of hypercholesterolemia and tobacco use who developed waxing and waning left substernal chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder on 2011-11-17 which lasted that entire day .
Upon waking on the morning of admission , she had 10/10 chest pain associated with nausea .
She presented to Charlton Memorial Hospital Hospital Emergency Department with inferior ST elevations ; at which time she became acutely hypotensive to a systolic blood pressure of 70 to 80 after receiving one ublingual nitroglycerin .
She then became bradycardic which responded to atropine and intravenous fluids .
In addition , she was given aspirin , Plavix , heparin , and morphine .
Immediately prior to transfer to Worcester State Hospital , she went into ventricular fibrillation arrest at 12:30 p.m. , at which time she was intubated and defibrillated back to sinus rhythm after five shocks .
She received an amiodarone bolus of 150 mg intravenously and was continued on an amiodarone drip while CMED CSRU-flighted to Boston Regional Medical Centerr where she underwent a catheterization .
The cardiac catheterization revealed a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery and diffuse right coronary artery disease .
She received three stents to the right coronary artery which was complicated by a proximal dissection .
She had good post percutaneous coronary intervention angiographic results .
Incidentally , an aortogram during the catheterization revealed a Debakey class I aortic ascending aneurysm , and the patient had a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20 at the time of catheterization .
She was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit in stable condition and still intubated .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypercholesterolemia .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
" Flumaran " for circulatory problems .
She receives this medication by mail from her relatives in Jill .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION TO CORONARY CARE 0408398 .
Amiodarone drip .
2. Integrilin drip .
3. Intravenous fluids .
ALLERGIES :
A question of a SULFA allergy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone in Woburn .
She came from Czech Republic 14 years ago .
She works as a nursing assistant in a nursing home .
She smokes approximately one and a half packs of cigarettes per day for the last 30 years .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Family history is not significant for any early history of coronary artery disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION :
Examination on admission to the Coronary Care Unit revealed blood pressure was 100/57 , with a mean arterial pressure of 75 , heart rate was sinus rhythm at 75 , temperature was 97.6 , oxygen saturation was 99% on assist control with a tidal volume of 600 on 60% FIO2 , 5 of positive end-expiratory pressure .
In general , she was sedated at the time , responsive to stimuli , and was following commands .
She had moist mucous membranes .
Her carotids were 2+ bilaterally .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly .
Her heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a faint second heart sound and second heart sound .
No audible extra heart sounds .
Her abdomen was obese and had positive bowel sounds .
It was soft and nontender .
She had peripheral edema with 2+ peripheral pulses bilaterally .
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION :
Her laboratories at the time of transfer to Saint Vincent Hospital revealed white blood cell count was 11.5 , hematocrit was 42 on admission , platelets were 242 .
Chemistry-7 was unremarkable .
Creatine kinase on admission was 309 , with a MB of 19.6 , an index of 6.3 , and an initial troponin of 0.73 .
RADIOLOGY / IMAGING :
A chest x-ray revealed an enlarged mediastinum with clear lung fields bilaterally .
Initial electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 65 , normal axis , 2-mm ST elevations in lead III , 1-mm ST elevations in aVF and V1 , 1-mm ST depressions in I and aVL ; consistent with an inferior and right ventricular infarction .
Right-sided electrocardiograms showed 1-mm ST elevations in V4 ; consistent with a right ventricular infarct .
Electrocardiogram status post percutaneous coronary intervention revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 84 , with a
normal axis , and normalizing of the inferior ST segments , with Q waves evolving in leads III and aVF .
An echocardiogram status post percutaneous coronary intervention revealed an akinetic inferior wall and right ventricle , mild mitral regurgitation , and ascending aorta measuring 5 cm .
There was no effusion .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM :
On the night of admission , the patient experienced post catheterization hypotension which required intravenous fluids and dopamine .
Electrocardiogram the following morning revealed normalization of her ST segments with evolution of Q waves .
Her dopamine was weaned off the following day , and her heparin was discontinued secondary to a right groin hematoma which had developed after the sheath had been pulled out by the fellow .
Her creatine kinases climbed ; reaching a peak of 3523 , which was down to 1500 at the time of discharge .
Also noted on the day of 11-20 , the patient self-extubated herself .
For her coronary artery disease , status post catheterization , she was given Integrilin for 18 hours .
She was continued on aspirin , Plavix , and Lipitor .
For her rhythm , amiodarone was discontinued as she was maintained in sinus rhythm after moving to the floor .
For pump , once transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit on 2011-11-20 , a beta blocker was begun at 12.5 mg of Lopressor p.o. b.i.d. which was titrated to 25 mg at the time of discharge .
Also , at the time of discharge , for increased afterload reduction , she was started on lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
On 2011-11-21 , the patient experienced atypical chest pain which was made worse with inspiration and movement .
It was not associated with any nausea or vomiting .
It did not radiate .
It was felt to be pain secondary to her self-extubation and noncardiac chest pain .
An electrocardiogram was checked which revealed no ST changes , and there was no increase in her downward trending creatine phosphokinases .
No further intervention was done .
The patient was treated with Tylenol orally as well as Ativan for anxiety that she had about going home .
She was pain free on the day of discharge .
Regarding her aortic ascending aneurysm , Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted regarding further workup .
At their request , a CT scan of the chest with contrast was performed on the day of discharge .
Dr. Streeter from Cardiothoracic Surgery will follow up with the patient for further management in approximately one month as an outpatient .
His office will contact her to make that appointment .
2. PULMONARY SYSTEM :
As stated above , the patient self-extubated herself .
She complained of a sore throat which was likely the etiology of her atypical chest complaints .
This resolved with Tylenol and as needed doses of oxycodone .
Her lungs remained clear to auscultation bilaterally throughout the remainder of her hospital course .
At the time of this dictation , the CT of her chest was still pending .
The official result was not yet in .
3. FLUIDS / ELECTROLYTES / NUTRITION :
The patient 's electrolytes sere managed daily and repleted on an as needed basis .
She did receive intravenous K-Phos for a low phosphorous of 1.5 .
Her phosphorous rose appropriately to 3.6 at the time of discharge .
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP :
1. The patient has an appointment to initiate primary care , as she no longer had a primary care physician .
Claire was to see Dr. Michael Majerowski at the Sturdy Memorial Clinic on the east campus , on Bissonette Six , in the South Suite , on 31-05-03 at 11:30 a.m.
2. In addition , as stated above , Dr.Hastings office from Cardiothoracic Surgery will be in contact with Ms. Williams to arrange followup for her ascending aortic aneurysm in approximately one month .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 75 year old righthanded Caucasian female who was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital because of left facial droop and hand weakness after glaucoma laser surgery .
She was transferred to the Sas General Hospital for further evaluation of some weakness in the setting of multiple medical problems .
The patient had o.d. glaucoma surgery , 1400 hours , on May 12th , 1992 .
Soon after surgery , the patient noted her left lower face and hand were weak .
She was brought to the emergency room where she was evaluated and determined to have had a cerebrovascular accident .
She has absolutely no neurologic disease in past .
The review of systems is negative .
However , two days prior to admission , one family member noted that the patient had a transient left facial droop .

BUN 27 , with a creatinine of .9 , glucose was 182 , but otherwise electrolytes were normal .
Her admitting hematocrit was 45% , white count 7,700 , with an MCV of 92 , platelets were normal at 263,000 .
Albumin 2.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
# 1. cerebrovascular accident .
The patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .
This was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .
The possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .
Her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .
Previous echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital .
Her Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .
The patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .
She was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .
Her exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .
Her pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .
She needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .
In addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .
It is discontinued at the time of transport .
The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .
During evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .
On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .
There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .
At the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient &apos;s family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .
What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .
Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .
Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .
Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .
As I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .
While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .
Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .
These tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .
The results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .
I will be happy to furnish the results .
The patient has a history of MI in 1989 .
Echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .
EKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .
We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .
Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .
The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .
It has been evaluated in the past without success .
During her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .
Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .
Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .
This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .
Florinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .
The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .
In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .
This has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .
CT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .
A chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .
A PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .
The left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .
The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .
Dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .
It is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .
It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .
The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .
We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .
This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .
The patient has glaucoma .
Her medications are as listed below .
Her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .
His name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Propanolol 5 mg. p.o. t.i.d. [ hold for SBP less than 110 ] , Isosorbide 5 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , hold for SBP less than 110 , Colace 100 mg. p.o. b.i.d. Pilocarpine 4% one drop q.i.d. O.D. Pilocarpine 2% one drop b.i.d. O.S. Betasan 0.5% one drop b.i.d. O.D. .

Coumadin 5 mg. p.o. q.h.s.
She needs her dose on 5/22/92 .
Heparin i.v. drip at 400 units per hour , on her arrival .
In addition the patient requires occupational therapy and physical therapy .

Mr. **NAME[AAA] is without complaints this morning .
On examination his fever curve has come down nicely .
His vital signs are stable .
His heart rate has come down into the 90 's .
His abdomen is soft and nondistended and nontender .
Breath sounds are somewhat diminished at the base with some bronchial breath sounds posteriorly .
Extremities are warm and dry .
Laboratory examination shows BUN and creatinine of 38 and 1.2 today .
Ins and outs were overall net balanced in last 24 hours , 1.5 liters of urine output .
White blood cell count 8000 .
Blood cultures showing gram-positive cocci from a aerobic and anaerobic bottles drawn from the PICC line .
The plan today is to pull his PICC catheter .
I ordered a repeat peripheral blood cultures x 2 .
He remains empirically on Zosyn , Flagyl , and Vancomycin .
I suspect the PICC line infection is the most likely site of his fevers and rigors that occurred previously .
I stopped his TPN today when we got the PICC line .
I left him on to D5 normal saline .
He is a stable for transfer to 9G today .
Vascular surgeons should be by sometime this afternoon to write transfer orders .

Brief Hospital Course :
1) GI - In the Monica pt had Hct of 20 and bloody NG lavage which did not clear .
She was transfused 1U PRBC , GI consult called , also got zofran and iv protonix and admitted to the FICU .
On arrival to unit pt had EGD which revealed grade III esophageal varices with signs of old bleeding .
She was started on octreotide and nadolol to control portal htn .
Pt was stable and had appropriate Hct bump to 25 after 2U PRBC 's.
She also had climbing bilirubin and low grade temp and was started on Zosyn for suspected biliary obstruction and ascending cholangitis coverage .
She was rescoped on 10-28 and varices were sclerosed ( no banding due to latex allergy ) and diuretics of lasix and aldactone were readded for ascites since BP stable .
10-29 she was transfused another 3U PRBC 's with hct bump to 31.9 and antibiotic coverage broadend to Unasyn , Ceftriaxone , Flagyl because she continued to spike , and for SBP prophylaxis .
Preprocedure of PTC on 10-30 she was transfused 1 unit PRBC 's, 2 platelets and 2U FFP and procedure went without complication .
ON transfer to the floor she remained hemodynamically stable with stable Hct and declining bilirubin .
She remained afebrile so on 11-02 antibiotic regimen was weaned to only levofloxacin .
Liver teams recommended to repeat EGD with non latex banding in 7-10 days .
She also went home on naldolol 20 mg qd for portal htn , and her home doses of diuretics to control her ascites .
2. US finding - Pt was incidentally found to have R hydronephrosis and a R adenexal mass on her US .
The hydronephrosis was likely caused by blockage by her tumor .
Given her disease prognosis and the fact that her other kidney is functioning well , no intervention was done .
Also the adenexal mass may represent a second primary maligancy .
This was seen on a prior CT scan and her oncologist is aware .
Again given the patient 's poor disease prognosis , there was no intervention made at this time .

The patient had an absolute neutropenia with a ANC of 318 ; differential revealed 48 segs , 6 bands , 40 lymphs , 4 monos .
Digoxin level was 1.4 .

Chest x-ray showed enlarged heart with mild pulmonary vascular redistribution , no gross congestive heart failure was noted .
EKG showed question of MAT vs. atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 118 , axis was 0 degrees .
There was ST scooping in the lateral leads consistent with Dig vs. a question of chronic ischemia changes .
There was no significant change from his baseline EKG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .
He was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .
Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units .
The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 &apos;s range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .
He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &apos;s after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .
His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 .
The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .
It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his LDH was within normal limits .

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Vinktlandfreierm was admitted from Owaleharbo Tanaminer Hospital to which he had been discharged approximately four days prior to admission .
He was noted to have dark stools per rectum and to be somewhat fluid overloaded .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and found to have a significant hematocrit drop from 33.8 to 24.3 .
He was found operation be short of breath and was taken to dialysis for apparent fluid overload .
His gastrointestinal bleeding issues were investigated with an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple superficial gastric ulcerations consistent with an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs gastropathy .
He had been discharged on one aspirin a day with 20 of Prilosec b.i.d.
The aspirin was discontinued and he had no further problems with gastrointestinal bleeding and a stable hematocrit the rest of his hospitalization .
During the course of his hospitalization , he became increasingly lethargic .
An extensive work-up was done for any metabolic abnormalities which was unrevealing .
He responded somewhat to lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy .
He had one positive blood culture for Vancomycin resistant enterococcus .
In the few days prior to his demise , he was intermittently somewhat lethargic buton the morning of June 25 , 1999 , his white count was noted to have increased from 8 to 13,000 .
That day , he was found to be acutely short of breath with a respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturations in the mid seventies .
He was put on 100% nonrebreather and his oxygen saturations improved to the low nineties .
Nasal trumpet suction was done and he was found to have food like material that was easily suctioned out .
He was also found to havesome pieces of toast in his mouth .
Blood gases were done and he was found to have a pH of 7.2 with a pCO2 of 21 .
Fingerstick glucose revealed a sugar of 12 .
A stat panel 7 confirmed that the sugar was 23 and that he had a new anion gap of 40 .
Repeat blood gas was done which was almost identical to the first .
The family was called and came in to see the patient .
An extensive family meeting was held and the family agreed that it did not make sense to intubate the patient and send him to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the acute setting , he had been started on levofloxacin , Flagyl , and Vancomycin .
These antibiotics were continued but the family decided that they wanted us to emphasize the comfort of the patient and pursue no further invasive measures .
The patient was made do not resuscitate / do not intubate .
At 2:30 on June 26 , 1999 , I was called to see the patient who had expired .
DISPOSITION :
The family was notified and came in to see the patient .
The family declined an autopsy saying that they felt that the patient had been through enough .
The patient &apos;s attending physician , Dr. Erm Neidwierst , was notified as well .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Delta MS Rachel Rohrer .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 33 - year-old Asian-Caucasian male with a history of Type 1 diabetes , asthma , alcohol abuse , and personality disorder / depression admitted on 2010-08-28 for persistent hypoglycemia .
The patient complained of diaphoresis , confusion , dizziness , lightheadedness after drinking a 24 ounce beer and taking at least an extra 15 units of NPH insulin the evening of 2010-08-27 ( later reported over 70 U insulin administered from 2.30 PM until time of presentation ) followed by not eating dinner .
His symptoms mildly improved after eating a candy bar .
The EMS was called and found his blood sugar at the time to be 61 and noted to be 41 in the Emergency Department .
He denied any seizure activity , loss of consciousness , incontinence , shortness of breath , fevers , or chills , chest pain , change in urinary or bowel habits , or suicidal ideation .
He has been depressed recently regarding stress with his home life and on the night of his extra insulin doses , his wife had just kicked him out of the house .
He has had four past hospitalizations for attempted suicide with insulin overdosing , usually denied .
The wife also states that he drinks more than he states .
In the Emergency Department , he received 3.5 amps of D50 and then D5 normal saline and D10 normal saline with blood sugars that were slow to increase leading the ICU team to suspect that the patient had taken more insulin than he admitted .
He also had a very positive tox screen for alcohol .
His fingersticks are currently in the 200 s and his normal blood glucose at home ranges between 90-200 per the patient .
The patient also now complains of increased right upper quadrant / right rib cage pain and new headache .
He also complains of chronic photophobia which is unchanged .
He denied visual changes , lightheadedness of dizziness currently , neck stiffness , or pain in any other area .

Extraocular muscles were intact .
Sclerae were anicteric .
Moist mucous membranes , clear oropharynx .

LABORATORY / RADIOLOGIC DATA :
CBC with a white count of 6.2 , hemoglobin 13.3 , hematocrit 39.4 , platelet 307,000 .
Sodium 142 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 104 , bicarbonate 30 , BUN 7 , creatinine 0.7 , glucose 41 .
Calcium 9.6 , magnesium 2.2 , phosphorus 7.4 , vitamin B12 level 320 , folate 9.5 , TSH 1.4 , acetone negative .
Serum tox screen , alcohol 32 mg per deciliter , negative for aspirin , benzos , barbiturates , and TCA .
Urine tox screen negative for benzos , barbiturates , opiates , cocaine , amphetamines , and methadone .
Telemetry was notable for episodes of sinus tachycardia to 120s to 140s only .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. HYPOGLYCEMIA :
The patient had been initially very hypoglycemic on admission secondary to overdosing on insulin ; however , with glucose repletion both in the Emergency Department and in the ICU , this resolved and the patient also began to eat .
We checked fingerstick glucoses q.i.d. and at 3:00 a.m.
His glucose on the morning of discharge was about 60 so we opted to decrease his p.m. NPH dose slightly for discharge and continue covering him with sliding scale insulin .
He should also continue having a snack at midnight if able .
It is likely that he required a much greater amount of insulin as an outpatient due to poor compliance with Richard Natalie diet .
2. ALCOHOL ABUSE :
It is likely that the patient continues to drink more than he admits .
He did have past alcoholism consisting of a half a pint of brandy per day for three years but supposedly had quit in 2009-09-03 .
He had been on a diazepam CIWA scale prophylaxis against DT s; however , he had a very low CIWA scale during his entire admission and did not need any benzodiazepines .
This alcohol abuse may be further addressed as an inpatient on the Psychiatry Quincy Medical Center .
We had also requested a Social Work consult regarding this .
3. DEPRESSION vs. Borderline personality disorder :
The patient has had several admissions in the past for attempted suicide with overdose of his insulin and though he denied at this time attempting to end his life , it appears that the social situation of increased stressors corresponding to this time suggest that this is not the truth .
He received a one-to-one sitter during his admission and will be transferred to the Psychiatry HealthSouth New England Rehab Hospital to ensure the patient 's safety and initiate further antidepressant treatment .
He will need close follow-up regarding his depression as an outpatient , although apparently this has been set up for him in the past and he had not followed through .
4. HISTORY OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE :
His blood pressure was fairly low with a maximum of 130s systolic during his admission , thus we did not continue his lisinopril which he had been on in the past .
5. RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN :
We obtained a right upper quadrant ultrasound as well as LFTs , amylase , and lipase which were all normal .
He had no evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones or any abnormalities with the liver or kidneys .
it is possible that he has had a muscle strain or other musculoskeletal cause .
6. PROPHYLAXIS :
He was put on Pepcid for GI prophylaxis .
7. FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES , AND NUTRITION :
He complied with Linda Chad diet while hospitalized .
The patient was hyperphosphatemic secondary to overadministration of Neutra-Phos during his ICU stay .
He was given two doses of calcium carbonate 1 gram , and will most likely normalize secondary to both calcium binding and urinary excretion .
He has been asymptomatic .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Stable .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Depression .
2. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus .
3. Asthma .
4. Alcohol abuse .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Insulin NPH 10 units q.a.m. , 5 units q.p.m.
2. Humalog sliding scale insulin for fingerstick blood glucose 151-200 2 units ; 201-250 4 units ; 251-300 6 units ; 301-350 8 units ; 351-400 10 units ; greater than 400 12 units .

On 04/06/05 Mr. Liley was admitted to Dr. Liley &apos;s service .
At that time he was made NPO with IVF , placed on Ampicillin / Levofloxacin / Flagyl and underwent IR placement of a drainage catheter for his abdominopelvic fluid collection .
Overnight he spiked a fever to 103 and his WBC climbed from 11 to 13 .
As a result , IR reviewed the patient &apos;s post-procedure imaging and felt that the catheter was not adequately draining the patient &apos;s fluid collection .
On 04/07 they took the patient back to the IR suite and placed a second catheter .
The location of the second catheter was confirmed that evening by a follow-up scan which revealed good placement .
The following day the patient defervesced .
Neurologic :
The patient &apos;s pain from his catheters was controlled with Oxycodone and Motrin .
CV :
No active issues .
R :
The patient received chest PT and was encouraged to ambulate frequently .
GI :
After catheter placement , the patient was started on sips .
He tolerated this well .
He was advanced to clears which he tolerated and was restarted on a low residue diet .
His bowel function resumed and in fact he had loose stool .
He had 3 specimens sent for C. difficile which were negative .
GU :
The patient &apos;s electrolytes and fluids were monitored closely during his admission .
Heme :
The patient &apos;s WBC trended down to 10.7 at discharge from a peak of 13 on 04/07 .
His hematocrit remained stable .
He received DVT prophylaxis with SC Heparin .
ID :
Blood cultures 04/05 revealed Bacteroides fragilis ; 04/06 Fluid collection drainage from IR revealed

On February 10 , 1994 , flexible bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy .
Multiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 &apos;s .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient &apos;s family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

ADMISSION DATE :
5-3-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
5-12-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Adult respiratory distress syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Urinary tract infection , tracheostomy status , diabetes mellitus .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Stain was transferred from the Oreiewlefell Merkane I Penaltbridgesgreat University Medical Center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis .
His only positive result was a sputum culture for Pseudomonas and this came after he had already been on antibiotics .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on transfer showed an alert male with temperature 100 degrees , blood pressure 120/64 , heart rate 80 .
He was intubated with pressor support of 25 , and PEEP of 12.5 with 70% FIO2 .
Tracheostomy tube was in good position .
There was an audible air leak .
His chest showed bilateral rhonchi .
The abdomen was distended with active bowel sounds .
The rectal examination was unremarkable .
Extremities showed trace pulmonary edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
A chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates , greater in the lower lung fields than in the upper .
The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 83 , with an 11 degree axis , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The sputum Gram stain showed a few polys and no organisms .
The blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , pCO2 of 48 and pH of 7.47 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it .
He also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky .
The patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas he was known to have .
The steroids were tapered .
He was also begun on anti-Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen .
Because of the story of hemoptysis , he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner &apos;s and Goodpasture &apos;s .
These results were all negative .
He continued to require very high FIO2 .
He was found to have a DVT by ultrasound .
He underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin .
This produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion .
He stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement .
In consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done .
At that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Granrivern Call is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
He was later seen by Dr. Flo Cuchkote at the Ph University Of Medical Center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
Over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
There was no definite clonic activity .
There was no known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .

SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
chest x-ray clear .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
There was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .

The patient is a 70-year-old female with cryptogenic cirrhosis .
She has a history of esophageal varices and a history of an Upper GI bleed .
She has had one pervious episode of variceal bleeding with an unclear date .
However she is followed by a Dr. Joasscchird at Vaila Medical Center .
She was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she felt increasing fatigue , nausea and vomiting productive of bright red blood and coffee ground emesis .
She also had some black , tarry stool in her colostomy bag .
At Vaila Medical Center , she had a hematocrit of 25 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells .
She had an upper endoscopy at Va Sit Namar Healthcare showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .
She was started on Pitressin , a Blakemore tube was inserted .
She was transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Intensive Care Unit where on January 25 in the morning her hematocrit was found to be 27.4 .
She was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .
The GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .
Her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .
after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .
At that time she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to Coden 2 for the Lemgarson Hospital service .

LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for sodium 141 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 109 , bicarb 19.8 , BUN 38 , creatinine 1.2 and glucose 388 .
She had a pneumonia of 31 , calcium was 7.5 , phosphorous 3.0 , magnesium 1.3 .
Her bilirubin was 1.4 total , 0.2 direct .
alkaline phosphatase 101 .
SGPT 22 , SGOT 41 , amylase 31 , lipase less than 1 .
LDH was 38.9 , CK was 66 , her hematocrit was 27.4 , white count was 8.0 and her platelets were 55 .
PT was 14.5 , PTT 25.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the Lemgarson Hospital service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
Her PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .
The rest of her labs were unremarkable .
She was watched very closely while on the floor .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until January 26 when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
She therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to North Dakota .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. Joasscchird , tel. 090-249-6079 , at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and Dr. Acrookesjo at Do Of Hospital , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with AH and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. Acrookesjo in one week and Dr. Work the gastrointestinal fellow here at PUOMC in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Zoloft 50 mg PO QD , Lactulose 15 g PO BID , Synthroid 0.15 mg PO QD , Prilosec 20 mg PO BID .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 25 year old who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a pericardial window .
He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer .
He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
It was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath .
The family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on December 4 , 1995 by Dr. Reg Cranka and Dr. Win Shufffyfe .
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
1. Neurologic and Psychologic :
The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression .
He is a paraplegic from T4 down .
Otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities .
The patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease .
2. Cardiac :
The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure .
He had a cardiac catheterization on December 1 , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on December 11 , 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% .
There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation .
There is trace pulmonary insufficiency .
The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on December 6 , 1995 .
A copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records .
The patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
These may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed .
The patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge .
The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal .
His medications for his respiratory system are Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
3. GI :
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy .
The patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on December 25 , 1995 .
This showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract .
There is no fistula seen .
Dr. Asha Vengloan of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
The patient takes poorly his po. diet .
However he is able to swallow and tolerate po&apos;s .
He just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding .
The patient is able to tolerate po. medicines .
4. GU :
The patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes .
It has been noted to be improving .
The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes .
5. Skin :
The patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti .
Plastic Surgery was consulted Dr. Ca Shuff who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point .
These wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings .
The patient &apos;s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased .
6. Infectious Disease :
The patient &apos;s white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits .
The patient remains on Fluconazole .
His other antibiotics were discontinued .
His most recent cultures are negative .
The chest X-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia .
7. Pain .
The patient has been very closely with the Pain Service here while admitted .
He has been placed on Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3hours as needed for pain .
The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued .
The patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior .
The patient for sleep was given Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. qhs. and was not allowed any increases in his narcotics after weaning him down to just requiring the Oxycodone .
A complete summary of the patient &apos;s medications are as follows :
Cimetidine 300 mg. intravenous q6hours .
Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
Senokot two tablets po. bid or Metamucil one tablespoon po. bid .

In summary this is a 25 year old male with a very complicated history and a patient of Dr. Breunkays &apos;s .
The patient was seen at Ph University Of Medical Center for problem regarding his constrictive pericarditis and underwent a surgical procedure to correct this .
Followup cardiac studies showed there was a resolution of his constrictive pericarditis .
The patient also had a gastric ulcer repaired at the same time .
Other issues of the patient are chronic and most likely will be followed up in hospitals closer to the patient &apos;s home .
If there are any questions regarding his care they should be directed to Dr. Cranka &apos;s office at Ph University Of Medical Center and we will be happy to contact any or all of the consultations concerned with Hauth &apos;s care .
Hauth is a very complicated patient and it was our pleasure to provide care for him at Ph University Of Medical Center .

The patient is a 28-year-old woman who is HIV positive for two years .
She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint .
She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child .
She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive .
She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission .
At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity .
She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI .
She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month .
She has had similar pain intermittently for last year .
She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise .
She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers .
In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver .
She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys .
Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal .
Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then .
The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss .
She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle .
She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative .
She did not have any of her pain in the hospital .
On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet .
She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge .
A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly .
The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present .
There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant .

Chest xray reveals no consolidation or signs of edema .
CT shows a right parietal hyperdense and heterogenously enhancing mass measuring 6.5 x 5 cm with the surrounding vasogenic edema in effacement of the right lateral ventricle .
The finding was most consistent with metastatic disease and less likely primary CNS neoplasm such as glioblastoma .
MRI showed a large heterogenous enhancing right parietal mass lesion with a possible ependymal spread .
The patient was admitted to the Neurologic Service for workup of his tumor .
The neuro-oncologist felt that because of the tremendous tumor burden that was likely causing his symptoms the patient will require open debulking as well as obtaining issue for a pathologic diagnosis .
Thea patient was referred to Dr. Coma of the Eragnes Houseco Ardbay Memorial Hospital .
On May 5 , 2005 the patient was taken to the operating room for a right parietal occipital craniotomy and debulking of the tumor using stulz neuro navigation .

The patient was also started on Mannitol .
His pathology came back as a large grade IV glioma .
The patient &apos;s pain was initially controlled with IV pain medications but at the time of discharge to the rehab facility he was able to control his pain on po pain medications .
The patient did have a postoperative serum sodium in the 120s from the 130s three days postoperatively .
An endocrine consult was obtained to help manage his serum electrolytes .
The patient was started on three grams of sodium , 3x a day with fluid restriction .
Over the next several days his sodium levels were followed and by 5/12/05 his plasma sodium was back to 136 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is an seventy eight year old female with history of peripheral vascular disease who is status post above knee to fem pop bypass graft with 6 millimeter PTFE .
This operation was performed for two months of increased rest pain .
Her pain resolved after surgery and she has been doing well since , although at baseline now she is minimally ambulatory from bed to commode .
For the past couple of months the patient has had a non-healing right dorsal foot ulcer which has been increasing in size and started as a pin hole and she does not recollect any trauma , as similar small ulcers developed on the left foot as well around the same time , but that has subsequently healed .
The ulcer was managed conservatively at Har Hospital by Dr. Holes with Silvadene b.i.d. lower extremity non-invasive study obtained at that time showed poor distal right extremity perfusion .
The patient was referred back to Dr. Pop for the possibility of a revascularization procedure .
She is status post angiography today .
She has just finished a ten day course of Ciprofloxacin .
She denies any fevers or chills .
She does have rest pain in the right foot and ankle .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted and taken to the operating room on the following day and she underwent a right fem to below knee popliteal bypass graft using a six millimeter ring PTFE .
She had a strong popliteal doppler pulse intraoperatively and good PVR on the right postoperatively .
The patient did well in the postoperative period .
She was afebrile , her vital signs were stable .
She was making adequate urine output anywhere between 20 to 50 ccs an hour .
Her hematocrit was 26.8 and she was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells .
Her diet was advanced from clears to a diet as tolerated .
On postoperative day two the patient was noted to have some swelling in her left lower extremity and this was felt to be a hematoma secondary to her PVR cuff .
There is mild amount of surrounding erythema and the patient was started on Ancef at that time .
The patient was seen by physical therapy .
The area of erythema on her left leg enlarged slightly and the patient was placed on Vancomycin for several days after which time her erythema again began to decrease .
Her right foot remained warm .
She had wounds which were clean , dry and intact and the patient was stable from a respiratory standpoint using her respirator at night .
The patient required an additional blood transfusion during her hospital stay as her hematocrit had decreased to 27 on postoperative day three .
The patient while in bed had her legs elevated .
The patient was tolerating a general diet , she was voiding on her own and the patient was discharged to home as her daughter is a nurse .
She was discharged with PO Keflex that she was to take for the next ten days .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Pop in one week and the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs at the time of discharge .
LAYMIE ASLINKE , M.D.
Admission Date :
06/11/1991
Discharge Date :
06/22/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .
Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at Vanor .
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
On ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .
She was evaluated by Dr. Mielke , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .
She was admitted to Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
She was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further care .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was no evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06/18 .
She was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .
Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .
She was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .

She has not complained of any fever , shaking , or chills .
No nausea or vomiting , no change in her bowel movements .
She has had attacks treated with antibiotics in the past notably in 12/96 and 08/97 .
She has had a diagnosis of diverticulitis flairs and baseline diverticulosis flairing in 09/96 .
Also , three years prior in 1993 , she had an attack of diverticulitis .
She has been worked up with barium enema in 09/97 which showed multiple diverticula throughout the colon , but mostly in the sigmoid .
At this time , there was diverticulosis with no acute diverticulitis .
There was also no obstruction .
The patient is also status post aortic valve replacement in 1996 , and presented for heparinization prior to her elective valve surgery .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and begun on cefotetan and Flagyl , as well as heparin .
Her INR dropped to 1.6 prior to surgery , and her PTT was in the mid 80s prior to surgery .
She was admitted and placed on a bowel prep two days before surgery and was taken to the Operating Room on hospital day # 3 , 10/28/97 .
At that time , she underwent sigmoid colectomy and ventral hernia repair . ( A full account of this operation can be found in the Operative Note ) .
She tolerated this procedure without complications initially and was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition .
Postoperatively , she had her heparin restarted , and had a PTT rising to 142.8 and then down to 92 .
Her primary postoperative development was the passage of some blood clots and blood per rectum on postoperative day # 2 .
She continued to pass blood per rectum and was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells .
Her preoperative hematocrit was 41 and her hematocrit dropped to 30.4 on postoperative day # 2 .
This was a drop from an immediate postoperative hematocrit of 35.4 .
Upon receiving the one unit of red blood cells , her hematocrit returned to 33 , and in the two days subsequent to the transfusion , returned to 34 .
Otherwise , her postoperative course was uneventful with gradual resolution of the passage of blood per rectum .
Her heparin was discontinued when it was noted that she was bleeding per rectum and her PTT drifted to a normal range of 35 by postoperative day # 3 .
On postoperative day # 1 , the patient was restarted on 2 mg of Coumadin .
However , due to the episode of bleeding on postoperative day # 2 , the Coumadin was held for two consecutive days , and then restarted on postoperative day # 4 .
At this time , she is given 3 mg and was gradually increased to her regular regimen of 4 mg alternating with 3 mg.
The patient &apos;s INR had dropped to 1.7 at the time of operation , and remained in this range initially , but began to rise to 2.0 with her Coumadin dosing .
At the time of discharge , it was 1.9 , for which she received 4 mg.
On the next day , it was 1.6 and she returned to a normal dosing of 4 mg followed by outpatient draws to determine the further Coumadin dosing .
This was postoperative day # 6 , at which time she is ready for discharge .
The rest of her hospital course was unremarkable , with perioperative ampicillin , gentamicin and Flagyl discontinued on postoperative day # 1 .
She had some initial nausea but had no emesis .
Her nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day # 1 , and she tolerated a regular diet by postoperative day # 3 .
She had flatus and regular bowel movements by postoperative day # 5 .
She also complained of some slight dizziness upon getting up .
For this reason , her normal Lopressor and Norvasc were held .
It was felt that this was re-equalibration after being sedentary and mostly in bed following the operation .
She had some slight headaches which resolved with Tylenol , and the dizziness resolved as well .
She was ready for discharge on postoperative day # 6 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Eugene is a 67 year old male with a remote history of chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse 30 years ago , who is transferred now from Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital for an ERCP and work-up for a cystic lesion at the head of his pancreas on CT scan shown at the outside hospital .
The patient presented initially to Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital at the end of December for abdominal pain , and was found to have pancreatitis .
During this admission , two CT scans had shown a question of an enlargement of the head of his pancreas
versus early pseudocyst .
The patient was discharged home early from this admission due to family needs .
While at home , the patient did not do well and could tolerate minimal food intake and lost about 20 pounds in one month .
On an office visit on 01-14 , the patient was found to have significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase .
That evening , the patient again developed abdominal pain " like his pancreatitis " with nausea and vomiting , for which he was admitted to the Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital .
In the Emergency Department at the Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital , the patient was noted to have vomited some heme positive material .
His complete blood count showed 11% bandemia with a total white count of 10 .
A HIDA scan showed no flow , question of pancreatitis versus common bile duct obstruction .
His electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm .
A chest x-ray was unremarkable .
During his admission to Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital , the patient had dropped his hematocrit to the 30 s with recorded melena .
He received an MRCP which was negative for evidence of stones .
An ultrasound showed normal gallbladder with no wall thickening but a dilated common bile duct of 8 mm measured on CT scan .
The patient had an attempted ERCP on 01-18 , which was unsuccessful due to a long nipple like papilla .
He was therefore transferred to Saints Medical Center for endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography .
The patient 's blood cultures at outside hospital grew out Streptococcus sanguis-gordonii on 01-18 .
This was sensitive to Clindamycin , Erythromycin , penicillin S and Vancomycin .
Prior to this result , the patient had already been on Ampicillin , Sulbactam and Gentamycin .
It appears from the Discharge summary that the patient was placed on Unasyn 3 grams intravenously every six hours after his ERCP .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 48-year-old G 3 P 3 who presented to Dr. Fuscmadril &apos;s clinic after having an abnormal pap smear followed by an endometrial biopsy that was suggestive of grade 1 endometrial cancer .
This is a patient who , over the past year , has had no menses and thought she had become menopausal .
She then began spotting for several months with some constant brown discharge .
A pap smear that was obtained by her primary care physician showed an endometrial cell and thus she was referred to a gynecologist for an endometrial biopsy .
The endometrial biopsy showed grade 1 endometrial cancer .
A decision was made to proceed with surgical management for this finding .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on the day of her surgery which was 09/20/00 .
She underwent a TAH-BSO which was uncomplicated .
Details of the procedure can be found in the operative dictation .
In short , frozen pathology from the uterus showed that there was a grade 1 cancer with no invasion of the myometrium .
There was no nodal dissection done at that time .
The patient tolerated the procedure extremely well and did well during her postoperative course .
By postoperative day #2 she was eating , ambulating and voiding on her own .
She decided to now be discharged home at this time .
She was discharged home with the following medications :

He was transferred to Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center from the rehabilitation center where he had been discharged to on 2010-08-25 following his CABG/MVR .
At the rehabilitation center the patient developed shortness of breath .
A chest x-ray done at that time revealed a left-sided infiltrate versus effusion .
He was transferred to Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary for treatment .
At the time he complained of no chest pain , weakness or cough , although he is intermittently short of breath .
He had been anticoagulated during his stay at rehabilitation for atrial fibrillation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Vencor Hospital .
He was given fresh frozen plasma to correct his INR and a left chest tube was placed .

History of Present Illness :
This is a 37 y/o male patient with PMH Type I DM , HTN , gastroparesis , ESRD on HD ( last in 12/26 per patient ) who presents to CMED CCU with hypertensive urgency unable from the Larry .
The patient early this morning to the Ruthie with his usual nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain and was found to be hypertensive to 256/110 , HR 102 , T 99.2 , RR 22 , 92% RA .
History is difficult to obtain from patient d/t somnolence and lack of desire to participate in interview , but per Frank note he was diaphoretic and ' writing in pain ', vomiting clear substance .
He was given ativan a total of 4 mg of ativan , 6 mg of dilaudid , labetolol 20 mg IV x 1 and hydralazine 10 mg IV x 1 without good response ( 200/99 ).
He recieved 2L NS and was started on labetolol gtt and BP decreased to 161/79 .
Tranferred to CMED CCU for further management while on labetolol gtt .
Of note , the patient is admitted to hospital 3 times every month for similar complaints with last admission 1/20-2/1/07 .
At that time BP was attributed to abdominal pain and inability to take PO meds d/t nausea / vomiting .
Also had labile blood sugars with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia , and Strickland recommended sugars in the range of 150-200 .
He eloped prior to formal discharge when his FS was found to be critically high - recommended to patient that he stay for repeat , but left AMA without signing any forms .
Upon transfer to the CMED CCU the patient appears somewhat uncomfortable , reporting nausea and abdominal pain , but when questioned he was unable / unwilling to participate in HPI or exam d/t sleepiness .
He denied CP , SOB , HA , vision changes , neck stiffness , dysuria , or other symptoms .
In the CMED CCU he became hypotensive to SBP 80 s.
Labetalol was stopped and he received a 500 cc fluid bolus and his blood pressure rose to SBP 90 s.
Cardiac and infectious sources of hypotension were considered , but cardiac enzymes were not changed from prior studies and he had no localizing signs of infection ; blood cultures were sent and a ultrasound of the L arm AVF ordered to rule out abscess at the site .
He received a partial HD session , limited by hypotension .
Over night , his blood pressure trended up to 130 s systolic .
He was restarted on his home blood pressure regimen .
Renal consult team saw him 2019-01-20 and plan to next dialyze him on 2019-01-21 .
He was to be called out to the medical floor on 2019-01-20 but became somnolent after receiving pain and anti-nausea meds , so he stayed in the ICU for closer monitoring of respiratory status , which spontaneously improved .
His blood sugar at 10 pm was low at 22 and he was disoriented , which resolved with two glasses of juice ; he did not receive his standing dose of NPH that evening .
Blood cultures returned positive with GPC in pairs and clusters , so a TTE and surveillance cultures were ordered and vancomycin was started .
He was then called out to the medical floor on 01-21 .
Brief Hospital Course :
Pt admitted to medical floor in hemodynamically stable condition without specific complaints .
# hypertensive urgency :
Upon presentation it was unclear when last time was that patient took meds , but hypertension likely d/t inability to take meds in setting of N/V .
Also contribution of autonomic dysfunction .
No evidence of active end organ damage .
Pt was treated with labetalol gtt in CMED CCU which was weaned off on 01-20 .
carduac enzymes mildly elevated , felt 02-08 demand ischemia in setting of hypertensive urgency , CK and MB trended Mcewen at time of admission to medical floor .
Pt 's hypertensive urgency was resolved upon admission to the medical floor .
His SBP s ranged 140 s- 170 s .
He was restarted on his home regimen of antihypertensives without difficulty ( metoprolol 75 tid , clonidine patch and oral , nifedipine 30 SR q daily ).
he was discharged home with change in his regimen .
# bacteremia :
pt with 2/4 bottles coag neg staph on 01-19 and again on 01-20 .
PORT was felt most likely source , and pt has had at least 2 sets of + blood cultures since it was placed .
TTE was obtained which was not concerning for endocarditis .
pt without stigmata of SBE .
ID consult obtained which recommended removal of PORT , which was taken out on 01-23 .
Pt will compelete a 2 week course of vancomycin at hemodialysis , which has been arranged by renal service .
A PICC was breifly placed , however removed as it is unclear if pt can reliably flush this .
PORT will be replaced on 2019-02-11 per IR ( Dr. Welsh placed last PORT , then removed it on 01-23 ), ordered placed in OMR .
Indication :
diabetic gastropathy causing inability to toleral oral antihypertensive medication prompting repeated Donald presentation for hypertensive urgency .
Pt with surveillance cultures and port tip cultures showing NGTD on 01-24 , he will have futher surveillance cultures drawn at hemodialysis and followed by his nephrologist .
# n/v/ abdominal pain : pt with multiple admissions with similar complaints , etiology 02-08 gastroparesis , improves considerably with ativan , dilaudid , reglan , pt was tolerating PO meds / diet at time of admission to medical service and was restarted on oral reglan .
# DMI : Pt on sliding scale as inpatient and taking NPH 2 units BID at home .
pt with two episodes of hypoglycemia ( FSBS 22 and 27 ), etiology unclear , pt followed by Strickland , who recommend no changes to current insulin regimen .
will discharge pt with instructions to continue NPH 2 UNITS BID as Frederick Tracey recs .
# CAD - pt denied cp / sob throughout hospitalization .
Troponins rose at admission , however CK and MB trending Mcewen wat time of admission to medical service .
Etiology felt most likely demand ischemia in setting of original hypertensive urgency with persistent elevation of trop 02-08 ESRD .
Pt was continued on aspirin , metoprolol , nifedipine .
# ESRD : etiology likely 02-08 DM and HTN , pt tolerating HD well , and underwent dialysis without difficulty on 01-24 .
pt will be discharged home with plan to continue current dialysis schedule ( Tue / Th / Sat ).
In addition pt will be given vancomycin at dialysis x 2 week course ( last day 2019-02-05 ) given his PORT line infection .
He will have levels drawn at dialysis and be dosed with vancomycin as appropriate .
Plan is for surveillance cultures to be drawn at dialysis .
If negative , pt is scheduled for presumptively replacement of PORT on 2019-02-11 with interventional radiology ( dr. Arevalo ).
Pt continued on home regimen of calcium acetate 667 mg , 3 capsules TID .
# AV fistula : pt with h/o numerous clots in AV fistula .
No signs of infection presently , and tolerating dialysis without difficulty .
Pt was subtherapeuticon INR on admission , thus treated with heparin gtt .
coumadin held on 01-22 for PORT removal , and restarted on 01-24 .
Pt discharged with instructions to continue coumadin 1.5 mg po q daily with goal INR 02-09 .
# DISPO :
pt discharged home on 01-24 with instructions to complete 2 week course of vancomycin at hemodialysis for his PORT line infection .
an appointment was made with interventional radiology on 2019-02-11 to replace his PORT , under the assumption that his surveillance cultures from dialysis remain negative .
discussed this plan with renal service ( Anthony Mcknight ) who will communicate with pt 's outpatient dialysis service .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is an 86-year-old female with a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension who presented to the Emergency Department with a two day history of shortness of breath and easy fatigability .
She also noted increased dyspnea on exertion .
Prior to this patient could walk upstairs but now cannot .
She denies chest pain , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
However , the patient has noted some abdominal pain , intermittent times a couple of days , none on the day of admission .
Denied nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , bowel movement changes .
She has noted increased urinary frequency .
Denies fever or chills .
Of note , she has had recent medication changes which included discontinuing Diovan and starting terazosin .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine Service and treated for presumed diastolic and systolic dysfunction .
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function as well as hypokinesis of the lower half of septum and apex .
Also of note was the distal lateral wall hypokinesis .
The wall motion abnormalities were noted to be new .
It was believed that a troponin on admission in addition to the wall motion abnormalities she underwent a non-Q wave myocardial infarction prior to resulted in her current cardiac failure .
Throughout hospital course patient 's troponin trended down to less than 0.3 .
Heart Failure Service was involved .
She was continued with aggressive diuresis .
She was started on _________ with excellent diuresis , however , her renal functioning worsening .
A cardiac catheterization was deferred until the renal issue could be resolved .
However , her creatinine continued to increase .
Diuresis was halted and without improvement in creatinine .
Renal was consulted .
A renal ultrasound was obtained .
It showed a right kidney size of 6.3 cm and a left kidney size of 8.4 cm .
Given her hypertension which was very difficult to control , it was felt that she had renal artery stenosis and thus she underwent MRA of the kidney which showed severe right renal artery stenosis at its origin .
There was also moderate to severe focal stenosis of the left renal artery approximately 1.3 cm from its origin .
Dr. ______________ consulted on the case .
She was transferred to the unit overnight to assess volume which was noted to be optimal .
On 05-25 she underwent catheterization and subsequent stenting of the left renal artery .
Due to dye load required to assess the coronary disease were not visualized .
After the procedure the patient did well .
However , her creatinine has worsened up to 4.2 .
However , her urine output has improved .
She has not required hemodialysis at this time .
She will need close follow up of her renal functioning .
The patient is discharged to an extended discharge facility .

History of Present Illness :
95 yo male with PMH large right thyroid cystic mass eroding into trachea , who presented to St. Anne 's Hospital 2018-04-22 with hemoptysis and respiratory distress , now diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma .
.
Pt reports that he noticed a right neck mass last October .
The mass grew larger , to the size of a baseball .
It appears that FNA was performed but was non-diagnostic ( probably because anaplastic tumors tend to be necrotic ) .
The mass appears to be cystic in nature and has been aspirated at least 3 times , which decrease in size each time .
Now size is 6.5cm*6.5cm .
Plan for surgery in Oct was deferred 04-05 syncope and pacer placement for SSS; again deferred 2 weeks ago 04-05 URI; was planned for surgery this Thurday .
.
Pt was o/w in his USOH until 2-3 weeks ago when he developed a URI with symptoms of dry cough; no fever , chills , sore throat , myalgias .
Pt was treated with 3 days of an antibiotics , followed by a 10 day course of levaquin ( completed 2 days PTA ) .
Per pt and son , no James pna .
2 days prior to admission , pt developed hemoptysis; states he coughed up 4 tsp of blood .
1 day PTA , pt developed stridorous breathing and respiratory distress .
Pt was initially seen at Lahey North , where he was given steroids , with improvement in respiratory status .
Pt was transferred to New England Baptist Hospital , where his surgeon is located .
There he was admitted to the CMED .
Thyroid cyst was aspirated with removal of 300cc of fluid . 
Pt was given racemic epinephrine and Decadron 10mg IV x1. CT neck showed tracheal mass per nursing s/o ( pt brought CT ) .
.
Pt now breathing more comfortably .
He has not had fever and night sweats but reports weakness and weight loss for several months recently .
Brief Hospital Course :
Pt was transferred here for further mgmt of airway and large thyroid mass by our IP team .
IP found endotracheal obstructing tumor and extrinsic compression of the high trachea by thyroid mass .
After rigid bronchoscopy with removal of the intratracheal tumor component on 2018-04-24 , stat pathology showed anaplastic tumor .
He was tranferred to the CMED .
Subsequently extubated and his respiratory Sx are now improved .
Pt was seen by Rad Onc , who recommended transfer to the East Campus for XRT .
On the morning of possible radiation , patient and family met with interventional pulmonary team who explained that the most recent CT showed further invasion of the tumor into the trachea .
After a long discussion , patient and family asked to be made CMO .
Patient was started on morphine drip and palliative care team was consulted with recommendations to ensure comfort .
Mr . Davison died approximately 24 hours after decision to be CMO , on 2018-05-01 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 39 year-old gentleman admitted on 2009-05-01 to the Jewish Memorial Hospital referred from South Cove Community Health Center .
He is a 39 year-old gentleman with hyperlipidemia and smoking who presented with acute onset of chest pain since five in the morning with radiation to the left arm and nausea .
Symptoms resolved spontaneously .
He was taken to the Cath Lab at the Pinewood , Norfolk that evening where a stent procedure to the RCA was complicated by guidewire entrapment inside of a stent requiring CT surgery to do a thoracotomy with bypass and excision of the wire .
The case was complicated by an episode of coffee ground emesis and a bleed from femoral access site prior to CT surgery .
Gastroenterology was consulted and they recommended Protonix and felt it was due to peptic ulcer disease .

ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
Epistaxis to Coumadin in the past .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac catheterization 11/03 .
OTHER PROCEDURE :
Pulmonary function test 11/04 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68-year-old patient of Dr. Naka Jesc had two episodes of rheumatic fever as a teenager .
She has had chronic atrial fibrillation .
Coumadin has caused bleeding from the mouth and nose on two occasions , on one occasion with prothrombin time 13 , and has been replaced by anti-platelet agents .
She has had recurrent syncope since age 6 .
She has now had progressive heart failure .
A Holter showed atrial fibrillation with period of ventricular bigemini .
She cut down dramatically on smoking two years ago , but has continued to smoke , although , very recently , she admits to only &quot; two puffs &quot; per day .
She has not had hypertension or diabetes , and says he has lowered her cholesterol from 333 to 197 by changing her diet .
There is no family history of heart disease .
She has been treated with Vanceril for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She has had one gram per day proteinuria with normal creatinine .
She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 for a &quot; tumor &quot; .
She has had an appendectomy and cholecystectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , aspirin held , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
Transdermal nitroglycerin caused headache .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Heart rate 86 , irregularly irregular , blood pressure 142/86 .
Neck veins distended .
Carotids normal .
Chest clear .
Apical impulse not palpable .
Right ventricular heave .
S1 normal .
S2 narrowly physiologically split with accentuation of P2 .
No S3 or opening snap .
Grade II systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Grade II decrescendo diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Diastolic rumble at the apex .
Liver slightly pulsatile but no enlarged .
Pulses normal to the femorals with weak dorsalis pedis pulses .
Superficial varicose veins .
No edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit 44 , potassium 4.0 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.2 , blood sugar 115 , Digoxin 1.4 .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , incomplete right bundle branch block , right axis deviation , right ventricular hypertrophy and possible apical infarction .
Chest x-ray showed left atrial , right ventricular and pulmonary arterial enlargement and interstitial edema with small , bilateral effusions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac catheterization was performed without complication from the right neck and right groin on the day of admission .
Right atrial pressure was 12 with a wave form consistent with tricuspid regurgitation .
There was no tricuspid valve gradient .
Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly elevated at 120/60 .
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was markedly elevated at 38 , with a very large mitral valve gradient .
There was little or no aortic valve gradient .
Fich cardiac output was 3.0 and indexed 2.0 .
Arterial oxygen saturation was 85 percent .
There was minimal mitral valve calcification , normal left ventricular contraction , and 2+ mitral regurgitation into a large left atrium .
There was minimal aortic valve calcification , mild ______________ thickening , normal open , and mild aortic regurgitation .
There was mild atherosclerosis of the mid left anterior descending .
FVC was 1.6 or 58 percent of predicted and FEV1 0.95 or 45 percent of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas was 56/40/7.45 .
Because it would be ideal to place a mechanical valve if valve replacement rather that commissurotomy is needed , she was seen by Dr. Ca Shuff of ENT for her history of epistaxis .
He identified no bleeding source , but felt that the risk of nasal hemorrhage on Coumadin could be minimized interventional neuroradiology occlusion of the arteries to the nose bilaterally .
The patient was therefore referred to the Dr. A Eu Wave .
The procedure could not be scheduled during this admission .
The patient is , therefore , discharged after a three day hospitalization , with plans for re-admission for the neuroradiology procedure .
This will be followed by a trial of Coumadin , and then by mitral commissurotomy or replacement and probable tricuspid annuloplasty by Dr. Riemund C. Wave .
In the meantime , Lasix dosage is increased .
Potassium replacement has caused , according to the patient , marked hyperkalemia in the past .
DISCHARGE REGIMEN :
Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg q.a.m. and 40 mg q.p.m. aspirin 1 q.d. , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.

Transplant
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 37-year-old female who presents on an elective basis for a living-related kidney transplant .
The patient has a history of end-stage renal failure secondary to type 1 diabetes with a baseline creatinine of around 5 .
She is receiving a kidney from her sister .
The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , and insulin-dependent diabetes for 32 years .
She is status post myocardial infarction in April of this year and subsequently underwent coronary artery bypass surgery .
She present electively on the morning of her surgery with no recent changes in her medical problems .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area and taken electively to the operating room .
She underwent a living-related renal transplant in the right iliac fossa .
The operation was somewhat technically difficult secondary to a short segment of ureter which was anastomosed over a stent to the bladder .
Otherwise , there were difficulties , and estimated blood loss was minimal .
She was taken postoperatively to the recovery room already making a large amount of urine .
Intraoperatively , for immunosuppression she received thymoglobulin and Solu-Medrol .
She was started on Prograf and CellCept in the postoperative period .
She was also maintained on Bactrim postoperatively and did not require ganciclovir , as she and her sister were cytomegalovirus negative .
The patient 's initial postoperative course was relatively uneventful .
Her creatinine , which was 5 initially postoperatively , slowly dropped over the next few days until eventually reaching a low of 1 .
She did receive pamidronate on postoperative day one and received a total of four doses thymoglobulin .
Her steroid doses were slowly tapered over her hospital course , and her Prograf level was adjusted to maintain therapeutic values between 10 and 15 .
She continued to make good urine over the first few days and had her urine losses replaced with intravenous fluids .
On postoperative day three , the patient had an episode of shortness of breath that was evaluated by both the Renal and surgical residents .
It was found that she was in acute pulmonary edema and required transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
Her blood pressure at the time of this incident was in the range of 200/120 .
Her electrocardiogram showed no specific ST changes , but there was some loss of her R wave progression laterally .
Serial enzymes were drawn , and Cardiology was consulted .
With blood pressure control via a nitroglycerin drip and fluid restriction , the patient quickly improved and a had a relatively short stay in the Intensive Care Unit .
Throughout this time , her creatinine continued to drop , and there was no apparent deleterious effect on her transplant from this episode .
Her beta blocker was progressively increased , and her nitroglycerin drip was weaned down .
Two days after this event , she underwent an echocardiogram which was significant for slightly depressed left ventricular systolic function with severe posterior wall hypokinesis .
This was a change from her prior echocardiogram and demonstrated evidence of a small myocardial infarction .
Clinically , she did much better and her blood pressure was optimized prior to discharge .
She was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day five and was stable on the floor for the next two days .

She is unable to run without losing urine .
The prolapse is especailly large and uncomfotable when she tries to move her bowels and it is easier for her to do sowhile standing rather than sitting .
She has deep pain in intercourse .
Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was taken to the operating room on 2018-12-04 for TVH , sacrospinous fixation , SPARC , anterior and posterior repair with mesh , cystoscopy; for pelvic organ prolapse .
There were no intraoperative complications and the surgical field was hemostatic at the conclusion of the case ( see operative report for full description ) .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable in the PACU and admitted to the CMED CCU floor for routine care .
At 1645 12-04 , the patient was noted to be hypotensive to 70/40
HR 84 with symptoms of lightheadedness while lying supine .
There was no active bleeding noted at the surgical site on examination .
A STAT HCT drawn at this time was 31.2 .
The patient was re-evalutated at 2000 and was found to be tacchycardic to 115 with BP 104/50 using a manual cuff .
Urine output during the prior two hours had been 50cc and 24cc .
A STAT HCT drawn at this time was 19.5 .
The clinical picture was concerning for a post-operative hematoma .
The ICU was alerted to the patient 's disposition and the operating room was activated for urgent re-exploration .
The patient was taken to the OR on POD#0 for re-exploration with incision at 2243 .
Exploratory laparotomy revealed hemoperitonium and approximately 1 L of blood was evacuated .
There was approximately 500cc of retroperitoneal clot .
Despite laparotomy and re-exploration through the vaginal cuff , no source for the bleeding could be found .
At the conclusion of the case , the patient continued to bleed , allbeit at a less brisk pace .
The endotracheal tube was left in place .
Intraoperatively , the patient recieved 5u PRBC .
IR was consulted to identify the bleeding vessel with angiography , then perform embolization .
Tagged cell and angiographic studies performed immediately after re-exploration on 12-05 did not indetify active bleeding and no emobolization was indicated .
THe patient was stable and remained intubated .
The patient was admitted to the ICU for further care .
The patient 's ICU course was uneventful .
There was no evidence of continued bleeding and her HCT remained stable around 30 .
The pt self-extubated on POD #1 .
The patient developed a low grade fever to 100.1 on POD#1 which persisted to POD#2 and imperic treatment with gent/clinda was started .
The patient was stable for transfer to the CMED floor on POD#3 .
Antibiotics were discontinued on POD#8 and pt remained afebrile thereafter .

OTHER DIAGNOSES :
1. STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .
2. INTRAPARENCHYMAL BLEED .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Larsen was a 50-year-old salesman who in 12/26 was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .
He was found to have CML .
He was admitted on 06/07/00 for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
White blood cell count of 24.409 and platelets of 956,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient received his bone marrow transplant on 06/12/00 .
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On 06/24/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On 06/26/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Although the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on 07/01/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .
The patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on 07/02/00 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Gach is an 80 year old man with aprevious history of coronary artery disease who was transferred from Linghs County Medical Center to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital because of an apparent infected wound , including the PICC line in his right elbow and positive blood cultures for Staph. aureus associated with fever .
He has a history of myocardial infarctions in 1981 , 1992 and 08/97 with thelast episode complicated by anoxic encephalopathy .
He gradually improved but had recurrent angina requiring cardiac catheterization , demonstrating 90% left main , 95% ostial LAD and 30 to 40% mid-LAD with an occluded RCA .
CABG surgery with two vessel bypass was done on 11/18/97 .
He was then transferred to Linghs County Medical Center .
A PICC line was placed in his left antecubital fossa and on the day of New Years Eve he developed a fever of 102 and became lethargic .
The PICC line site was erythematous .
Blood cultures grew out 4 out of 4 bottles for gram positive cocci , which thereafter proved to be Staph. aureus Methicillin sensitive .
He had no chest pain , shortness of breath or diarrhea .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics .
A lumbar puncture was obtained which showed normal pressure and no cells .
The CSF culture was negative .
A stool assay was taken for Clostridium difficile which was negative .
The patient gradually improved on the current therapy and was quite awake and alert , though still appeared to have some evidence of dementia and disorientation .
He was encouraged to eat and it was decided not to place either a feeding tube or to start TPN .
Dr. Rhalttland was called at Sondi Memorial to update him on the patient &apos;s condition .
He still needs much intensive rehabilitation , encouragement to eat and encouragement to get out of bed to use the bathroom rather than abed pain or a diaper .
He is being transferred to Linghs County Medical Center for further care .

At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .
She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
She will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .
Her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .
It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient &apos;s young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .
So far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. po q.day , Captopril 75 mg. po three times a day , Nifedipine 40 mg. po three times a day .

ADMISSION DATE :
03/30/1999
DISCHARGE DATE :
09/16/2006
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 76 year old white male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia .
He was most recently discharged from Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to Linghs County Medical Center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 .
The patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area .
The patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter .
The patient was brought to the Emergency Room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by Urology and had his catheter changed .
The patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway .
On the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath .
The patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day .
The patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum .
He also denies any chest pain .
No orthopnea .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
The patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home .
By the time the patient arrived at the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room he was in moderate respiratory distress .
His initial blood gases on 40% 02 was P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 .
The patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered Do Not Resuscitate .
The patient was not intubated .
However he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of Albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics .
A chest x-ray in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs .
There were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe .
These were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
He stayed in the unit for about one day .
During that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with Albuterol .
He was also started on intravenous Ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia .
He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2L urine output on the first day and 1.5L the second day .
After one day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment .
This consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous Solu-Medrol .
As the patient &apos;s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved .
A chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe .
The patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia .
The antibiotic chosen was Levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day .
This was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days .
The Ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia .
The patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal .
It was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then .
The patient &apos;s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with Lasix .
While in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in Cimetidine while in the Intensive Care Unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease .
The patient was upgraded to Prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease .
The patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient &apos;s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to Prilosec .
While in Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently .
It is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living .
Discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home .
They wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
A 40-year-old female with history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in 2016-09-30 with stent to the LAD and 50% to the mid LAD , had instent restenosis in 2017-04-02 and then underwent brachytherapy to the RCA , who presented to Baldpate Hospital with several weeks of chest pain similar to her anginal equivalent and MI in the past .
It started at rest .
No relief with nitroglycerin x3 .
Radiates to the left arm .
Positive shortness of breath .
Troponins have been less than 0.01.
With history , will go for cardiac catheterization evaluation .
Still getting chest pain intermittently , but relieved by morphine sulfate .
Was on a Heparin and nitroglycerin drip with only intermittent relief .
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Chest pain :
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction .
However , with her history of disease , patient underwent a cardiac catheterization .
The patient was found at cardiac catheterization to have mild diffuse instent restenosis in the mid stent , otherwise hemodynamically normal and the coronary arteries otherwise were without flow-limiting stenoses .
The patient was then continued on her cardiac medications .
It was felt that if we attempted aspirin desensitize her while an inpatient , then she would benefit from the use of aspirin and Plavix .
The patient was sent to the CCU and underwent aspirin desensitization protocol , which she tolerated well .
She had mild worsening of her asthma attacks , which was relieved by Benadryl and occasionally albuterol .
The patient found that if she took the aspirin in the evening with her Benadryl that she takes for sleep , that the asthma exacerbation did not occur .
Aspirin no longer should be considered an allergy for this patient , and she is going to take this as an outpatient .
2. Hyperlipidemia :
The patient 's Lipitor was increased to 80 mg q.d.
3. Back pain :
This is a chronic issue and was controlled with Flexeril and Vicodin .

History of Present Illness :
46 - yo-man w/ active cocaine use presents w/ LE edema .
10 days ago , he developed b/l LE edema that has gotten progressively worse until now .
Three days ago , he developed dyspnea on exertion when climbing stairs , assoc w/ 2-pillow orthopnea and PND .
He denies any recent chest pain , palpitations , headache , confusion , weakness , numbness , abd pain , or hematuria .
No recent viral syndromes or URI s.
He does admit to cocaine use last night .
Today , his wife convinced him to present to the Deanna for evaluation .
In the Deanna , his BP was 230/170 .
BNP was elevated at 7500 .
CXR revealed evidence of cardiomegaly and pulm edema .
He was treated w/ ASA 325 mg , lasix 10 mg IV , and hydralazine 10 mg IV x 2 .
He responded well to lasix w/ good UOP , but diastolic BP remained elevated at 170 , prompting initiation of nitroprusside gtt .
He is now admitted to the CCU for further care .
Brief Hospital Course :
46 - yo-man w/ cocaine abuse presents w/ LE edema and DOE likely from diastolic heart failure in the setting of cocaine use complicated by hypertensive urgency .
Hypertensive urgency :
BP 230/170 on presentation , most likely from chronic HTN exacerbated by cocaine use .
No signs of end-organ damage at present except for elevated creatinine , which is more likely a chronic problem .
The patient was started on labetalol and Lisinopril .
His blood pressure was taken down from 230 systolic to approx 160 systolic / 100 diastolic on discharge .
His lower extremity edema improved with diuresis .
An echo performed on admission showed an LF EF of 25% .
It is hoped with good blood pressure control and use of an ACE-I with follow up in addition to cocaine abstaining will improved his cardiac function .
Renal Failure : creatinine on admission was 1.6 Likely acute hypertensive nephropathy plus probalbe long-standing hypertensive disease .
discharged on ACE-I .
Substance Use : Social work saw patient and counceled him regarding substance abuse .
Discharged with Margaret Hallock , cardiology follow up as well as scheduled appointment with a new PCP @ Newton Health Center .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Breunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .
She is referred for progressive angina .
She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .
She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .
In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .
In October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .
She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .
In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .
She had exertional angina at that time .
In November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .
She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .
Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .
She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
Because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .
In May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .
She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .
She has had no syncope .
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .
She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .
She is a remote cigarette smoker .
She also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .
She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci
She lives alone .
Her son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .
They live in Ohio .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .
Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .
She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .
Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .
The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .
The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .
The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .
This was considered her culprit lesion .
This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .
In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .
Her left internal mammary artery was also unused .
It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .
She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .
This was intermittent .
The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .
The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .
It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .
Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .
She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .
When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .
Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .
He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .
For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .
On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .
There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .
It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .
She tolerated this well .
Her medications were resumed .
She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .

50 yo male , h/o CAD s/p stent to LAD in 2011 , Hypercholesterolemia , DM , cocaine abuse , presenting with chest pain .
He states he had onset of this pain today ; described as anterior chest pain with radiation to right shoulder , 09-26 , was increasing over the course of 45 minutes to 1 hour ( occurred after arrested ).
He states that he also felt SOB and diaphoretic but denies n/v/palpitations .
He reports that the pain was increasing in intensity .
He was brought to Providence Behavioral Health Hospital where he was found to have positive urine cocaine , EKG with new 2-7392 W. Second Cr. elevations in the anterior leads ( v2-5 ) and some ST depressions in II , III , AvF .
He was given lopressor 5 mg x 2 ( 3rd dose given by medflight , 5 mg morphine , ativan , nitro gtt , heparin , and integrillin .
Pain was 12-28 at time of transfer .
In the cath lab , he was found to have hazy plaque in LAD ( prior stent ) , 80% hazy plaque in circumflex , and a totally occluded PLB ( with collaterals ) .
1 cypher stent was place in the LAD while 2 were placed in Lcx .
Right system was not intervened upon , for the PLB was unable to be crossed by wire .
He was transferred to the CCU for observation .
Brief Hospital Course :
1. CAD : presented with anginal symptoms and EKG changes ( STEMI ) , with cardiac catheterization revealing lesions in LAD , LcX , and PLB .
Unclear if hazy lesions significant or if this was cocaine induced vasospasm .
LAD and LCX were stented , but PLB could not be crossed by guidewire ( were collaterals ) .
- continue ASA , statin , Plavix ; will hold BB given recent cocaine use ( ? can consider labetalol if necessary ) , Integrillin for 18 hours
- CK negative .
TN WNL .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 53 - year-old female found down in hotel room by EMS with change in mental status and lethargy .
A suicide note found at the scene referenced multiple medical problems as well as suggested ingestion of beta blocker , muscle relaxant , and Neurontin .
Vital signs were stable on arrival in the David , but the patient was minimally responsive and subsequently intubated for airway protection .
Patient initially given 2 mg of Narcan , 4 amps of sodium bicarb , and 5 grams of activated charcoal .
Patient 's blood pressures were noted to decrease systolics to the 80s , which responded to IV fluids and insulin / glucose drips .
Also noted to be bradycardic to the 50s , which responded to atropine .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In summary , patient is a 53 - year-old female with multiple medical problems and history of depression with intentional overdose of barbiturates , opiates , Tylenol , and beta blocker .
CMED :
Patient was maintained on insulin , D10 and glucagon drips to maintain her hemodynamics .
This was achieved with good effect , and they were subsequently weaned off .
Patient was able to be extubated on hospital day three .
Psychiatry was consulted after the patient was extubated , and felt that patient had a high suicide risk , and plan was for her to be admitted to the Psychiatry service once medically stable .
Patient 's renal function remained stable and her CKs trended down gradually .
Patient remained on suicide precautions , but was deemed not to need ICU level monitoring , and was transferred to the floor on 01-11 .
In the a.m. of 01/08 , the patient experienced episode of tongue biting , unresponsiveness , disorientation .
Was loaded on Dilantin .
Became progressively hypoxic and tachypneic throughout the day with respiratory rates of 30-40 with a max respiratory rate of 116 , tachycardia to 120s .
Patient subsequently was transferred back to the CMED CCU on 2017-01-13 for further monitoring .
Patient 's hypoxia was felt most likely to be caused by pneumonia .
She was started on appropriate antibiotics .
Etiology of patient 's tachypnea was unclear .
Initially , the patient 's etiology of seizure was not quite clear , but thought possibly secondary to alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal .
She received EEG , MRI , LP .
Subsequently EEG was noted to have no seizure activity .
MRI was suboptimal due to motion artifact and LP was unremarkable .
Despite absence of seizure activity on EEG , patient was continued on Dilantin .
Her delirium was felt possibly secondary to withdrawal versus toxic metabolic , but gradually improved slowly , and therefore patient did not receive treatment for barbiturate withdrawal .
Her mental status , tachypnea , and hypoxia all improved , and patient was subsequently transferred back to the floor medical team on 2017-01-15 .
While on the floor , the patient 's mental status was noted to be improved back at baseline compared to that back to the CMED CCU , and she exhibited no evidence of barbiturate withdrawal .
She was continued on suicide precautions with a one-to-one sitter , and plan was for psychiatric admission when medical issues had resolved .
On 2017-01-16 , the night float intern was called to see the patient as she was unresponsive .
Patient unresponsive to verbal command , sternal rub .
Pupils were fixed and dilated .
Patient noted to be without corneal reflexes , spontaneous breathing , heart sounds , or palpable pulses .
Patient was pronounced dead at 6:15 a.m. on 2017-01-16 .
Patient 's family was notified and declined autopsy .
Given the sudden unexpected nature of patient 's death , the medical examiner was contacted and the case was accepted .
Of note at time of death , patient was DNR / DNI .
This was initiated after several conversations with the patient 's mother , who stated that the patient had desired to be DNR / DNI for many years , not just in the recent past .
These facts were confirmed via separate conversations with both the patient 's lawyer and her primary care physician .

She was oriented to person , place , time and purpose , she recalled three out of three objects at five minutes , she is able to do calculations .
She maintained her fixation on the conversation well .
The cranial nerve exam :
pupils reactive to light , extra ocular movements show good upgaze up to 3 mm. , good down gaze .
Right lateral gaze , the right eye had 2 mm. of sclera showing , the left eye was normal , and there are a few beats of right beading nystagmus .
The left lateral gaze , the left eye had 1 mm. of lateral sclera showing .
Disks were flat .
Sensory limb of the right eye corneal reflex is slowed , otherwise normal .
Seventh nerve weakness on the right in a central pattern is present .
Soft palate was in the midline and moved upward nicely , but did not respond to gag .
Tongue protrudes 2 cm. with slight deviation to the right .
Sensory exam was not remarkable , cerebellar exam was not possible .
Motor exam showed greater than 4+ strength bilateral upper extremities and psoas unable to lift off bed .
Quadraceps 2+ on the left and 3+ on the right .
Gastroc. 3 on the left and 4+ on the right .
Tibialis 3 on the left , 5+ on the right .
Reflexes were diffuse 3+ , toes upgoing bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , electrocardiogram showed less than 1 mm. of ST depression in V4 to V6 , which is likely the patient &apos;s baseline .
CK &apos;s were mildly elevated but the MB fractions were not remarkable .
A chest X-ray showed some left lower lobe atelectasis .
Admitting creatinine was .7 , glucose 131 , white blood count was 10,000 , hematocrit was 40 , liver enzymes normal range .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram .
She was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .
A small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .
She was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .
This was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .
For a short time , she seemed &quot; locked in &quot; .
She has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .
Trace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .
4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .
She is unable to lift either foot off the bed .
The extra ocular movements are full .
Tongue protrudes 4 cm .
She is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .
She has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .
She has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .
She is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .
She is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .
Follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .
The patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .
A chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .
Initially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .
Sputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .
A left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .
The patient is on Ciprofloxacin .
The day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .
She has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .
She also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .
Once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .
She has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .
The patient &apos;s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .
These have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .
The exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .
The patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .
Iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .
The plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .
The patient &apos;s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .
This is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .
This must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .
The patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .
This may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .
Her sodiums were never below 130 .
She does well with tube feeds .
Her tube feeds orders are as follow :
full strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .
In addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .
She also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .
She also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .
Please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .
It is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .
She has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .
She did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .
In the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .
This did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .
As of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .
Her cholesterol was 350 here .
She has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .
These can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .
Note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Metamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as above , Tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , Nystatin swish and spit 10 cc. five times a day , Cardizem slow release 90 mg.

Upon extrication from the vehicle , he was intubated and transported to the Emergency Room .
He was tachycardic with an initial blood pressure of 120 / palpable .
A groin line was placed and the patient was sedated and paralyzed .
He was resuscitated with Crystalloid and remained hemodynamically stable .
He had a grossly deformed left lower extremity .
On examination , Belmont Coma Scale was 6T ; blood pressure was 120 / palpable with a heart rate of 122 .
The trachea was midline .
The abdomen was soft .
Rectal was heme positive with normal prostate .
There were no meatal blood .
The left femur was grossly deformed with a pinhole opening in the lateral thigh .

There is no step-off at the back .
Admission laboratories included a hematocrit of 43.3 and white blood cell count of 25.2 , normal electrolytes and amylase of 98 .
Arterial blood gas showed a mild metabolic acidosis .
Additional assay shows slight widening of the mediastinum on chest x-ray .
The CT scan of the head and chest were negative .
There was a small liver laceration seen on the A/P pelvis .
There was a distal ulnar and radial fracture as well as a left mid-shaft comminuted fracture of the femur .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit .
He was also seen by the Orthopedics Service and Neurosurgical Service .
He went to the Operating Room quickly and had an intramedullary rodding of the femur and open reduction and internal fixation of the radius and ulna .
He was evaluated by Neurosurgery for his head injury which showed multiple contusions in the frontal lobe .
He was extubated on postoperative day two .
He did have some blood loss anemia with a hematocrit of 20.9 .
A repeat CT scan showed no change .
He was begun on Physical Therapy but remained agitated .
He was discharged to the Floor .
His hematocrit remained stable .
His cervical spine was cleared .
The patient was seen by Psychiatry due to some delirium and question of suicidal ideation .

He was raking leaves on 04-02 and then developed episodes of mid chest pain and burning which radiated to the left arm .
That night he reportedly stopped breathing and was unresponsive .
His wife gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and he regained consciousness .
He presented to an outside hospital with an acute inferior myocardial infarction and was treated with thrombolytic therapy .
His troponin was 20 and he had EKG changes .
He underwent catheterization on 2016-04-05 which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% , no mitral regurgitation , insufficiency or hypokinesis .
Left main coronary artery was narrowed 50-60% , left anterior descending coronary artery 70% proximally , right coronary artery dominant diseased up to 90% proximally in the midportion , 70% distally .
The left circumflex coronary artery was 50% proximally , 90% obtuse marginal #3 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 104 year old female patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , coronary artery disease , hypertension and cerebrovascular accident who presents with shortness of breath and cough .
The patient states that she has no idea why she was brought to the Emergency Department and denies any symptoms .
She reports an occasional nonproductive cough that she has had_ for years _and feels that she has been experiencing alternating chills and feeling hot .
A progress note in the patient 's chart from her assisted living facility indicates that the patient has had shortness of breath and cough for one day with chills but no fever .
She has been recently evaluated as an outpatient for bradycardia .
She was seen by her cardiologist , Dr. Clements and had a Holter monitor on 2015-05-01 , that showed first degree AV block with a rate that ranged between 35 to 53 beats per minute .
In the Emergency Department , the patient was given nebulizer treatment , started on antibiotics for presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation .
She was noted to have lateral ST depressions and given Aspirin .
She continues to deny chest pain , palpitations , shortness of breath , fevers , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , bright red blood per rectum , melena , dysuria , urinary frequency and urgency .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Shortness of breath - Though the patient denied shortness of breath on admission , a progress note from
Norwood nursing facility suggested that the patient had been having shortness of breath and cough for approximately one day with difficulty ambulating , needing to travel in a wheelchair .
The patient was afebrile on admission with a normal white blood cell count but had significant wheezing and rales on physical examination with a possible left lower lobe opacity seen on chest x-ray .
The etiology of the patient 's shortness of breath was considered a likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and the patient was started on Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers .
The patient was also started on Doxycycline given the concern for pneumonia on chest x-ray .
She was also continued on steroids given evidence of severe airway obstruction .
The patient 's shortness of breath was also considered possibly related to a coronary event and she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
The patient 's enzymes were cycled and were negative .
The patient 's electrocardiogram performed on hospital day number two was concerning for 2:1 heart block and the cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation .
The patient was taken to the Coronary Care Unit late on hospital day number two and received a temporary wire .
The following day the patient received a permanent dual chamber rate responsive pacemaker .
The patient was transferred back to the general medicine service where she continued to exhibit signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and nebulizers , steroids and antibiotics were continued .
The patient 's respiratory status improved throughout the remainder of her hospitalization and oxygen was eventually weaned .
Once the patient was transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit , she appeared to have an element of heart failure in addition to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She was given 20 mg of intravenous Lasix with impressive urine output and improvement in her overall fluid status .
The patient was eventually restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix once her renal function improved to baseline and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization .
Heart block - As noted previously , the patient 's electrocardiogram was significant for a 2:1 heart block and cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation .
The patient received a temporary pacing wire on the evening of hospital day number two and on hospital day number three received a dual chamber pacemaker .
Renal - The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.8 , considered likely secondary to hypovolemia .
Her calculated fractional excretion of sodium was 0.13 percent suggesting a prerenal cause .
The patient 's creatinine improved to 1.1 with hydration .
Once the patient 's creatinine had improved to baseline , her Lasix and ace inhibitor were restarted and the patient 's creatinine was noted to be stable .
Gastrointestinal - The patient was admitted with a history of gastrointestinal bleed with guaiac positive stools on admission .
Her hematocrit was noted to trend down after transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells on admission .
Given guaiac positive stools and her history of gastrointestinal bleed in addition to use of steroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , the gastroenterology consult service was contacted .
The results of that consultation and potential esophagogastroduodenoscopy are pending at the time of dictation .
Hypertension - The patient had moderate control of her blood pressure throughout her admission .
Her calcium channel blocker and ace inhibitor were continued .
Hematology - As noted previously , the patient 's hematocrit was noted to drop after transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells on admission .
Given guaiac positive stools and the patient 's history of gastrointestinal bleed , gastroenterology consult service was contacted for possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or colonoscopy .
The results of this consultation are pending at the time of dictation .
The remainder of the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course , discharge diagnoses , medications and follow-up will be dictated at the time of discharge .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Le is a seventy three year old male who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , following a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head .
Mr. Le was found in bed with a 32 caliber revolver at his side .
The patient was apparently alone at home , his neighbors heard a single shot , and the paramedics were called .
Upon arrival , they found the patient in bed , with notes nearby , listing his funeral home preferences and information on his next of kin .
The patient indicates that his neighbors were making excessive noise upstairs from his dwelling , and he found it unbearable .
He therefore decided to take his life with a gun which he had found in the house .
Apparently , the gun belonged to his father .
On further questioning , the patient described that his father passed away approximately forty to fifty years prior to his admission , and the gun was found in a box in their home .
The patient expressed concern that he had several utility bills that he was unable to pay .
The patient &apos;s sister died eight years prior to the patient &apos;s admission of leukemia , and he otherwise has no next of kin with the exception of one brother in Washington , with whom his relationship is tenuous .
On initial questioning , however , the patient denies any recent losses .
On admission , the patient denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca , M.D.
Prior to his admission , the patient &apos;s gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room .
The patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge .
The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter .
Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended .
From a medical standpoint , the patient did well .
He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization .
The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine .
After his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward .
Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen .
The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient , and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note .
By the 7th hospital day , the patient was medically stable .
He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation , and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital .
Therefore , because of his need for intense psychiatric care , the patient is discharged to the Vo Black Doylestrictshore Ft. Clinics Medical Center on the 7th hospital day .

Her epidural catheter was removed on 6/29 .
The Foley catheter was removed on 6/29 and she had no difficulties voiding .
Psychiatry Service saw her on 6/28 and recommended avoiding benzodiazepines and Haldol for agitation .
She was prophylaxed with Kefzol perioperatively and with Coumadin postoperatively .
She was also given whiskey spirits because of the fact that she drank one to two drinks of scotch per day .
Her hematocrit was 31.4 on 6/29 with a PT of 18.2
Her PT drifted down to a level of 12.9 by 7/3 and therefore she will be discharged with 4 mg of Coumadin per day to be followed by the Coumadin Clinic at Cowerin Tonli Medical Center .
She was discharged with a prescription for Tylenol #3 with Physical Therapy .
She did quite well with Physical Therapy and was ambulating with a walker and crutches by 7/3/90 .
She was able to flex her knees to 90 degrees by that time .
She developed no problems with edema or with her wound during her hospital stay .
She will follow-up with Dr. Koors in approximately five weeks .

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES :
Chest x-ray 10/10/97 :
Elevated left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology or duration .
Postoperative changes of the sternum and media stinum were seen and no acute pulmonary disease was visualized .
The patient also had a shoulder film done on 10/10/97 that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .
A lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on 10/10/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
Two major fracture fragments were seen at the humeral head , articulating with the glenoid fossa .
The fracture fragments retained their proper site of articulation with the glenoid fossa .
Innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal humeral shaft .
The glenoid fossa was intact .
No scapular fractures were present .
EKG :
normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , Q - waves seen in II , III , and AVF with probable old inferior myocardial infarction .
T - waves were also noted to be inverted in I and AVL .
Ventricular bigeminy was also seen .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
The patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
No chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on Columbus Day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
After his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin .
4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :
GI was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
A gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .
This report needs to be followed up , and will be available at Bri Health in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. Fordwoodall Stick , in Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156 .
The patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at Bri Health , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
The patient &apos;s admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient received chest physical therapy bid .
6. ENDOCRINE :
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , pH 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
He was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 and also had Nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .
The patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .
The patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 .
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 .
FEN :
Repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .
The patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .

Each episode lasted approximately 15 minutes in duration and resolved on their own .
This morning while landscaping the patient had unremitting 12-05 pain with shortness of breath and diaphoresis .
He presented to Deaconess-Nashoba Hospital Hospital and the first EKG was found to have ST elevations in V1-V3 of 1-2 mm with T wave inversions in V4-6 , I and L , which progressed to 3-0167 W. Seventh Ave. elevations within 20 minutes .
Heparin and nitroglycerin drip were started with 10 mg of IV Retavase half dose .
He was transferred to the North Adams Regional Hospital for catheterization .
Once at Hahnemann General Hospital he received heparin and Integrilin .
Coronary angiography revealed left main , left circumflex and RCA normal and left LAD with 99% midstenosis .
A Hepacoat stent was placed with no residuals but good flow after nitroglycerin and diltiazem .
The chest pain persisted afterwards and a relook catheterization was performed that revealed no occlusions .
The right heart catheterization revealed a cardiac output index of 4.11 and 2.15 respectively .
RA pressure was 13 , RV pressure 45/7 , wedge 27 and PA pressures of 42/21 .
He was transferred to the CC for monitoring and he denied having further pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting .
At baseline the patient denies any previous chest pain , pressure , dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea , PND or palpitations .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
For his coronary artery disease , aspirin was started at 325 .
Plavix was started at 75 mg a day , Lipitor 20 mg per day , metoprolol 25 mg twice a day to be titrated up as tolerated and on day two of admission an ACE inhibitor was started .
Captopril 6.2 3 x a day and titrated up .
A lipid panel was checked and found to be within normal limits , although it was noted this was in the post MI setting and the lipid panel could be falsely low .
Serial CK s were followed with a CK peak of 433 .
Hypertension was managed with beta blocker and ACE inhibitor and Integrilin was continued post MI for 18 hours .
Rhythm was maintained at normal sinus , monitored on telemetry without ectopy .
EKG s were followed for normalization .
The patient had an echocardiogram on day two of admission , which revealed a mildly dilated left atrium , mild symmetric LVH , normal LV cavity size , mild region LV systolic dysfunction , arresting regional wall motion abnormality including focal apical hypokinesis , a normal right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion , a moderately dilated aortic root , a mildly dilated ascending aorta , normal aortic valve leaflet , normal mitral valve leaflet and no pericardial effusions .
The patient was normal volume and displayed no evidence CHF signs or symptoms .
The risk factors were addressed .
The patient was told repeatedly that he needed to stop smoking and was given a nicotine patch and his primary care provider was called to discuss outpatient plans to help the patient stop smoking .
The patient was advised to have a low fat / low cholesterol diet , was cleared by PT and advised to do cardiac rehabilitation .
He was advised the importance of each of his and compliance with each of these medications and was told he needed close followup with a cardiologist .
For renal , his creatinine was monitored and the dye load and the catheterization .
It was normal and did not increase .
Gastrointestinal :
The patient was given a low fat / low cholesterol diet .
His electrolytes were monitored and repleted carefully .
He had normal bowel movements and had GI prophylaxis throughout his stay .
For hematology , the patient 's hematocrit and platelets were monitored after the catheterization .
They were normal and did not change and the patient received pneumatic boots for DVT prophylaxis .
On day two of admission , the patient ambulated with PT and was moved to the regular floor .
On day three of admission , the patient felt that his strength was back to baseline .
He denied ever having any chest pain , chest pressure , shortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and he was discharged to home .
He was told to return to the emergency department if he had any chest pain , pressure , difficulty breathing , nausea , light-headiness or dizziness .
He was advised to take all of his medications .
An appointment was established for him to see his primary care doctor , Dr. Stella Booth on Maynard , 2014-10-20 and the patient was referred to Dr. Granville Hamers , at Ware in cardiology to be seen in two weeks .

HEENT exam was within normal limits .
Lungs revealed occasional wheezing bilaterally at both bases .
Heart was regular with a I / VI systolic ejection murmur without jugular venous distention .
Pulses were 2+ bilaterally .
Abdomen was obese with positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended .
Examination of his shoulder revealed the patient to be able to flex his right arm to 170 degrees , internally rotate to 10 degrees and externally rotate to 40 degrees with positive joint tenderness .
All range of motion with his right shoulder was painful .
The left shoulder was identical in range of motion and was also painful .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the assessment of left rotator cuff repair and he was taken to the Operating Room on the day of admission where he underwent left rotator cuff repair under general endotracheal tube anesthesia .
There were no intraoperative complications .
His postoperative course was generally unremarkable except for a prolonged course of advancement with range of motion of his left shoulder .
Occupational therapy became involved initially and he remained on patient controlled analgesia secondary to problems with left shoulder pain .
He was kept in the hospital for an extended period to improve his postoperative range of motion .
However , he was eventually able to achieve forward flexion of 135 degrees and external rotation of 30 degrees by postoperative day number eight .
His wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .
However , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and Endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .
His hemoglobin A1C levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .
He was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .
It was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .
He also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus Neurology was consulted and EMG &apos;s were performed which were normal .
His neurologist was contacted , Dr. Cap , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .
Further work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .
Thus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good condition with a well healed left shoulder wound and doing well with occupational therapy with plans for him to follow-up with Dr. Necessary .

The patient is a 40 year old male with a history of prior anterior myocardial infarction and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus who was transferred from an outside hospital after an episode of acute shortness of breath and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history four years ago of being admitted to the Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital after suffering an acute anterior myocardial infarction .
The course had multiple complications requiring pressors .
He had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed a three vessel coronary artery disease with an occluded RCA , 70%-80% proximal LAD , and a high grade left circumflex lesion after the OM with distal left circumflex occlusion .
The patient was subsequently medically management after this hospitalization and has done very well .
His most recent echocardiogram in April of 1996 showed an ejection fraction of 20% with a thin fibrotic septum with akinesis and moderately severe hypokinesis in all other regions except for the lateral wall .
The patient also had an electrocardiogram in April of 1996 which was negative following , however was at a low workload .
The patient &apos;s was most recently admitted to Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center on Martin Luther King Day after becoming acutely short of breath after a five minute walk .
He had no chest pain , palpitations , diaphoresis , or nausea .
He called the EMT &apos;s and was found to be in pulmonary edema by chest x-ray at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .
He was diuresed and ruled out for myocardial infarction .
His ECG showed no ischemic changes .
He was then transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus x 15 years with no retinopathy or foot lesions .

FAMILY HISTORY :
His mother and father both died secondary to myocardial infarction .
One of his brothers has had a myocardial infarction .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature 100.3 , heart rate 76 , blood pressure 100/78 , respiratory rate 16 , and an oxygen saturation of 96% on two liters .
NECK :
No jugular venous distention .
CHEST :
Clear to auscultation with no wheezes or rales .
CARDIOVASCULAR :
Regular rate and rhythm with no extra heart sounds and no murmurs .
ABDOMEN :
Benign .

No edema with 2+ pulses .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 25 and creatinine 1.4 .
White count 6 and hematocrit 41.5 .
PT 14.1 with an INR of 1.4 , PTT 36.7 .
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates and no pulmonary edema .
Urinalysis was negative .
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 63 with normal intervals .
He had flat T waves in I and aVL , which were unchanged from previous ECG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for further management of his pulmonary edema .
It was felt that the patient possibly had a worsening of his coronary artery disease and therefore underwent cardiac catheterization on 01/17/96 .
At cardiac catheterization he had an RA pressure of 8 , an RV pressure of 52/10 , PA pressure of 60/25 , and wedge of 26 .
His coronary arteries revealed an 80% stenosis and a large OM .

It was felt that this cardiac catheterization was not significantly changed from his previous catheterization .
Given his high right-sided filling pressure , he was started on Lasix for diuresis and his Captopril was increased for greater afterload reduction .
It was felt that the patient should have an augmented medical regimen and as an outpatient undergo an exercise tolerance test with viability evaluation to determine whether he would benefit from revascularization .
He was restarted on Coumadin for his low ejection fraction and started on diuresis with IV Lasix for two days and then switched to an oral Lasix regimen .
DISPOSITION :
He was discharged to home in stable condition and feeling well .

This took place in 1983 .
In 1992 he underwent redo surgery and aortic valve replacement .
In April 1994 he presented with an acute inferior myocardial infarction and was given Streptokinase .
He had recurrent pain and went to the Catheter Laboratory where a proximal right coronary artery lesion was angioplastied .
A relook several days later led to a repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
He has has stable , mild angina , subsequently , mostly in the setting of stress .
Slightly increased in recent months .
On the day of admission , he was involved in a minor motor vehicle accident , and there was some apparent controversy with the driver of the other vehicle , during the course of which he developed substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm and shoulder .
This waxed and waned for thirty to sixty minutes , and he took a number of nitroglycerins .
After returning home after conferring with his wife , and the pain lasted another half hour , he came to the emergency room .
His electrocardiogram showed increased T wave inversions in V3 and V4 and 1 mm .
ST segment depression in V3 through V6 .
His examination was largely benign after he was made pain free .
The pulse was 75 , blood pressure 120/80 , respirations 18 , and he was afebrile .
The jugular veins were not distended , the carotid volume was diminished .
The chest was clear and the cardiac rhythm was regular .
There were normal prothetic valves .
There was a grade II-II apical and systolic murmur .
The abdomen was negative and there was no edema of the feet .

History of Present Illness :
Ms. Bridge is a 74 y/o female admitted to outside hospital on 2015-10-21 with chest discomfort , vomiting and shortness of breath .
Initial EKG showed ST depressions , but cardiac enzymes were not elevated .
She eventually underwent a cardiac cath to assess coronary disease which revealed three vessel coronary artery disease .
She was then transferred to The Hospital for Orthopedics for surgical intervention .
Brief Hospital Course :
Ms. Bridge was admitted from OSH for coronary artery bypass surgery .
She underwent usual pre-operative testing along with carotid ultrasound .
CNIS revealed carotid stenosis and she ultimately underwent left carotid stenting by vascular surgery on 10-30 .
Please see report for details .
On 11-02 she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 .
Please see operative report for surgical details .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition .
Later on op day sedation was weaned , she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated .
On post-op day one chest tubes were removed and beta blockers and diuretics were initiated .
She was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight .
Also on this day she was transferred to the SDU .
Early on post-op day two Ms. Bridge had an episode of aphasia .
She underwent an immediate head CT and Neuro consult and was transferred back to the CSRU .
CT was negative and she returned to baseline neuro status without deficits by arrival to CSRU .
Neurology concluded episode was most concerning for TIA .
Epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day four .
After remaining stable in the CSRU for several days without change in neuro status she was transferred back to the SDU on post-op day four .
She was then started on Heparin with transition to Coumadin ( goal INR of 2-3 secondary to h/o bilateral DVT 's).
During entire post-op course she was followed by physical therapy for strength and mobility .
She continued to improve steadily over the next several days without any other post-op 
complications .
She was discharged on post-op day 11 .

Mr. Vessels &apos;s postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so .
Recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in January 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis .
A repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease .
A biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils .
He was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil .
Chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly .
Prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure .
An echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed .
The echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction .
Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy .
The patient diuresed and responded to Lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed .
At 2:30 AM the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest .
Despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated .
Upon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and CPR was being performed .
The rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure .
There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions .
A pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid .
A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure .
In total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate .
The resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 AM and were begun at 3:38 AM .
The patient was pronounced dead .
Patient &apos;s mother was informed by Dr. Vessels .
An autopsy permission was granted .

DISCHARGE DATE : 
07/04/94 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
This 68 year old female had rheumatic fever in the past , and has had chronic atrial fibrillation . 
She has had progressive heart failure and an evaluation demonstrated worsening mitral stenosis with severe pulmonary hypertension . 
Because of her deteriorating status , she underwent prior cardiac catheterization , which confirmed severe mitral stenosis with secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation due to pulmonary hypertension . 
She was referred for valve surgery . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : 
The patient was brought to the Operating Room , on April 22 . 
She underwent a mitral valve replacement , utilizing a 27 mm . 
St. Jude prosthesis , and tricuspid valve reconstruction by ring anuloplasty . 
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with good hemodynamics . 
She initially awoke after surgery , with good hemodynamics . 
She was transiently in sinus rhythm , but atrial fibrillation recurred . 
She was extubated on the third postoperative day , and was initially slightly agitated and confused , largely due to an Intensive Care Unit psychosis . 
She continued to improve , with mobilization of fluid . 
She was initially noted to have a slow ventricular response in atrial fibrillation , but this gradually improved over time . 
She was initially noted to be somewhat anemic , and received transfusions . 
Coumadin was restarted , and her anticoagulation came into range . 
She was ultimately discharged with a heart rate in the 90 's , and with resolving edema and a clear chest . 
ADMISSION DATE :

DISCHARGE DATE :
03/13/2002
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 79-year-old man status postradical cystoprostatectomy with ileal loop for locally invasive prostate cancer .
This operation was performed 2/11/02 by Dr. Doje Para .
The postoperative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with transfer to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit .
This transfer occurred around postoperative day 8 for anticoagulation and amiodarone load .
The anticoagulation was stopped due to concern for postoperative bleeding .
The patient complained of fevers .
The patient presented to the emergency room on 3/7/02 , complaining of fevers since Monday 3/2/02 .
He developed erythema around the wound on Wednesday and was seen by Dr. Para , who started Keflex and obtained a CT scan which demonstrated a fluid collection at the site of erythema .
The fevers continued as high as 102.5 degrees F with chills on the morning of admission .
He was draining pus from the wound site with subsequent relief of discomfort at the site .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Urology .
After the wound was further opened , he was started on ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl antibiotics and he was placed on a bid dressing change and packing .
On hospital day 2 , the patient had no complaints .
He was afebrile with stable vital signs and good urine output .
The wound erythema was improving and the wound was packed twice a day .
Wound cultures remained negative at that time .
We continued his ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl .
By hospital day 4 , he remained afebrile throughout his hospital course .
The wound cultures demonstrated gram-positive cocci in clusters and gram-negative rods .
Blood cultures remained negative .
The patient was continued on antibiotics and we obtained a CT scan to check for an enterocutaneous fistula .
We discontinued his Flagyl on that day .
We contacted the patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. Aslinke ______ , regarding his cardiac medication management .
We agreed that he should resume his atenolol .
He was started on 2.5 mg PO qd .
He was continued on his dressing changes .
We changed the dressings tid instead of bid for continued drainage .
The CT scan that was obtained on 3/10/02 demonstrated no connection between bowel and the wound .
The drainage had been decreasing and the patient continued to be afebrile .
On the following day , 3/11/02 , a fistulogram was obtained which was negative for a fistula from the bowel to the wound .
The patient was continued on ampicillin and Gentamicin .
Her remained afebrile with stable vital signs .
He was comfortable and erythema continued to decrease with improvemeent in the appearance of the wound .
In consultation with Infectious Disease , it was agreed to discharge the patient on Augmentin for coverage .
We obtained sensitivities of his wound bacteria .
His intravenous antibiotics were discontinued .
He remaineda febrile with daily improvement in the appearance of his wound .
On hospital day 7 , the patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs .
His wound demonstrated no erythema with moderate dark drainage .
The patient will be discharged with WH and continued dressing changes bid .

DISCHARGE DATE :
8/23/93
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68 year old female has rheumatic heart disease .
Mitral and possibly tricuspid valve surgery is scheduled for Labor Day by Dr. Riemund C. Kennedy .
Her history is detailed in the discharge summary of August 10 of this year .
She is admitted now for a neuro-interventional radiology procedure to decrease the likelihood of epistaxis on Coumadin .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The interventional neuro-radiology procedure was performed by Dr. A Skizeis , on August 22 , via the right femoral artery .
The right internal maxillary artery supply to the nasal mucosa was embolized .
The left external carotid artery was occluded at its origin , with collaterals from the internal carotid artery .
Thus , embolization on the left side was not possible .
The patient received Coumadin , 10 mg. , on the evening following the procedure , and is discharged the next day .
Her prothrombin time will be rechecked on August 27 by her primary care physician , Dr. Naka Gift .
Once her prothrombin time is in therapeutic range , she will be observed for epistaxis .
She will take her last dose of Coumadin on September 1 in anticipation of cardiac surgery .
If her prothrombin time does not come into therapeutic range promptly , then surgery may be delayed .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 78-year-old woman had stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix and she has known periaortic and splenic metastases .
She was discharged from the hospital about 18 days prior to her admission , following a month long stay .
When her cancer was diagnosed , she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
She had extensive disease of the uterus , ovarian tubes , omentum and the periaortic lymph nodes .
Postoperatively , she developed ileus , then finally she recovered and she was discharged to the nursing home .
She was readmitted because of a problem with uremia and high BUN and creatinine when she seen in the office and the BUN and creatinine was ordered .
The BUN was 70 and creatinine was 4.6 and for this reason she had ultrasound of the kidney which showed bilateral hydronephrosis .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for ureteral stent placement .
On the day of admission , she was generally stable and she had no evidence of disease in the pelvis , no bleeding and no other abnormality .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. Jescdrig was called and a consultation was done and he placed bilateral ureteral stents in her kidneys .
Postoperatively , she diuresed very well .
She had dropped her BUN and creatinine to normal and she was found to have may be metastatic disease to her skin on the right paraumbilical area .
Because of her age and mental condition and the fact that she had cerebral atrophy , the decision was made for comfort unless she has any further problem and no further chemotherapy or treatment will be given .
The possibility that she may need to receive radiation therapy to this area to prevent her from getting further obstruction was also brought up .
Her family felt that at the present time , because her condition was no good , they would like to just take her home so that she could enjoy the quality of life .
Indeed , at the time of discharge she was conscious and she was cooperative and she was able to communicate very nicely with everyone including her family , except for the mental instability that she had because of her cerebral atrophy due to senility .
FOLLOW-UP :
She will be followed in the Centu Fairgmer Queen Medical Center .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Factor is a 76 year old white male with acute inferior myocardial infarction , who was urgently transferred by Dr. Lenni Factor for cardiac catheterization and possible angioplasty .
His only cardiac risk factor includes hypertension .
The night of Oct 14 , 1999 the patient developed chest discomfort associated with shortness of breath .
On October 15 , 1999 at 6 AM the patient was admitted to No Verlmerver Medical Center .
An electrocardiogram showed acute inferior myocardial infarction .
Due to unknown duration of the chest pain thepatient was transferred urgently to the TGCHO for cardiac catheterization .
Shortly after Aggrastat was started , the patient became pain free .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was directly admitted to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
Coronary angiography , right heart catheterization and percutaneous intervention of the RCA were performed from the right groin without complications .
The proximal RCA was totally occluded with good left to right collaterals .
The LAD showed a 40% stenosis in the proximal segment .
The circumflex showed mild atherosclerotic .
The RCA occlusion was successfully dilated and sent using a 3.0 X 23 mm Duet with post stent dilatation up to 16 atmospheres .
Following intervention right heart catheterization was performed to rule out RV infarct .
The RA was 5 .
PA was 19/7 with a mean of 13 .
PCW was 11 .
Of note there was a clear A wave in the RV tracing , suggestive of RV infarct .
The next day the patient was quite confused and disoriented , which gradually disappeared .
An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate the LV function , which showed an ejection fraction of 53% with inferoposteriorakinesis / hypokinesis .
The next day the patient &apos;s mental status came back to baseline and he remained free of angina .

History of Present Illness :
This is a 39 year-old female with a history of diabetes type I on an insulin pump , anemia , hypothyroidism , gastroparesis , GERD , who was transferred from Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital for further management of hypoxic respiratory failure .
She arrived at Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital on 07-01 for 1 day of nausea and vomiting and was found to be febrile to 99 at that time .
She was admitted for likely gastroparesis and eventually had a complete fever work-up that included a negative chest x-ray , blood cultures , and urine culture .
She was discharged on 07-02 and represented that day with continued nause , vomiting , and fever .
She was readmitted and had a complete febrile work-up that included CT abdomene / pelvis , chest x-ray , blood culture 's , urine cultures , all of which were unremarkable .
She was intubated on 07-03 for progressive respiratory failure .
Workup continued to be negative .
Extubation was attempted on 07-14 , but she was re-intubated due to inspiratory stridor .
A CT neck showed soft tissue swelling obliterating the airway surrounding the ETT tube .
She was transferred to Providence Behavioral Health Hospital for further management .
Brief Hospital Course :
This is a 39 year-old female with diabetes type I , hypothyroidism , gastroparesis who was transfered for hypoxic respiratory failure .
1. Hypoxic Rspiratory Failure :
She arrived intubated and sedated from Esteban Hospital .
On arrival a chest x-ray showed perihilar and bibasilar opacities , which appeared conistent with pulmonary edema but also possibly consistent with a pneumonia .
There was no evidence of ARDS .
She was known to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum at the outside hospital .
A bronchoscopy with BAL was performed and a sputum sample eventually grew out MRSA .
She was treated with vancomycin to cover her MRSA pneumonia .
A CT scan was performed on 07-17 to evaluate the soft tissue swelling seen on CT at the outside hospital .
The CT showed increased soft tissues within the pharynx which was felt to be secondary to prolonged intubation / trauma .
She was treated with steroids for this swelling at the outside hospital , and these were continued .
It was decided that patient should receive one more trial off the vent before committing her to a tracheotomy .
She did well on minimal vent settings but it was decided to delay extubating the patient until the morning of 6/2 .
Overnight , the patient became hypoxic , dropping to the 80 's .
A chest x-ray showed that the ET tube was displaced to very high in the trachea .
The cuff was deflated and the patient was extubated .
She was placed in supplemental oxygen by shovel mask and her sats immediately improved .
She was weaned down until she was maintaining her oxygen saturation above 90% on 6L by nasal cannuala .
As she was doing well without evidence of stridor , the steroids were stopped .
She did well and was weaned from supplemental oxygen .
At the time of discharge , she was oxygenating well on room air .
She Will need to complete a 14 day course of vancomycin for her MRSA pneumonia on 2019-07-30 .
2. Enterobacter bacteremia :
She was initially covered broadly with vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , and falgyl .
She had positive blood cultures at Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital for gram negative rods .
Subsequently , zosyn was added .
The cultures grew out enterobacter cloacae .
It was unclear the source of her bacteremia .
Her stool cultures were negative .
Her central line was removed and the tip was culture negative .
She was transitioned to on levofloxacin for her bacteremia .
She had no positive cultures during this admission .
Once she was more stable , an abdominal CT was performed to look for an abscess .
This study was negative .
However , the study was limited due to inadequate po contrast intake by the patient ; it did show a question of a cecal cystic lesion verse normal loop of bowel .
This study will need to be repeated once she is tolerating po 's .
She will complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin for her bacteremia on 2019-07-30 .
3. Diabetes type I :
She was intially maintained on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control .
She was followed by Albano during the admission .
She was initially maintained on D5W , which was increased to D10W as the patient was persistently borderline hypoglycemic while on insulin drip .
Once she began to take PO 's , the insulin drip was stopped and patient was started on glargine with a humalog sliding scale .
While her po intake was minimal she was maintained on supplemental IV dextrose to suppress ketosis .
While she was on the IV dextrose , she required up to 26 units of glargine for glycemic control .
As she starting taking some foods , her glargine was decrease .
At the time of discharge her glargine was 10 .
Her blood glucose were under good control .
The day prior to discharge , she was nauseated and not taking pos .
Therefore , she received 1L of D5 , and her sugars were elevated to 400 the day of discharge .
4. Gastroparesis :
She has a history of gastroparesis secondary to long-standing type I diabetes .
Once she was extubated , she was nauseated with emesis .
She was intially treated with erythromycin for pro-motility as she had a bad reaction to reglan in the past .
She continued to remained nauseated so she was treated with phenergan , anzemet , zofran , and ativan .
She intermittently was able tolerate pos .
Her nausea was accompanied by abdominal pain for which she was treated with morphine .
She was transitioned to a PCA for better pain control .
She continued to have nausea despite an agressive anti-emetic regimen .
It was felt that her symptoms were secondary to gastroparesis .
However , other causes were looked for including adrenal insufficiency and bowel obstruction .
She had a normal cortisol stimulation test .
A abdominal plain film showed non-specific bowel gas patterns that may represent an early obstruction .
A NG tube was placed for decompression given the signs of early obstruction the day of transfer .
The GI service was consulted and they felt that her symptoms were all gastroparesis .
They recommended erythromycin and zelnorm .
She should eventually have a tissue transglutaminase to rule out celiac disease .
5. Transaminitis :
Per report , She had elevated LFTs at the outside hospital .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed and was negative for any acute pathology .
Her LFTs trended down during this admission .
6. Hypothyroidism :
She was maintained on her levothyroxine .
While she was not taking adequate pos , she was on IV levothyroxine .
7. F/E/N :
She was NPO while intubated and recived tube feedings for nutrition .
After extubation , patient was started on sips and had a speech and swallow evaluation .
She was cleared to advance her diet as tolerated .
She only tolerated some clear liquids .
At the time of transfer , she was NPO given her NG tube .
8. Prophylaxis :
PPI , Heparin SQ .
9. Access :
Her central line was removed given the concern for a line infection .
She had a double lumen PICC place .
10. CODE :
FULL
11. Dispo :
She was transfered back to Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital per the patient 's and husband 's request so that she would be closer to home once her respiratory status was stable .
anti-GBM is pending .

Mr. State is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .
In the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .
Upon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State &apos;s saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .
Chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .
The patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State &apos;s filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .
The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .

She has pleuritic chest pain which she has had since she arrested during her admission here and had CPR .
Per husband she has no cardiac history , and had a stress test ( unclr how recent ) that was normal
Brief Hospital Course:
Pleural effusion : s/p pigtail cath drain .
Imaging indicated that the pleural effusions had resolved .
Thoracics agreed to no need for pigtail placement .
CHF :
Patient was seen by CHF ( echo results are detailed above ) .
They recommended continuing beta-blocker and titarting ace as tolerated .
Patient should be kept euvolemic once peripheral edema resolves ( may use lasix to decrease edema ).
She will need a repeat echo in 3-6 months ( since this echo showed a question of focal wall motion abnormality ).
Also , patient was started on amiodarone and digoxin was held secondary to high levels ( please restart when level less than 2 )
Diarrhea :
Stool c. diff neg x1 .
She will need two more specimens .
COPD : cont nebs .
PAF : started on amio , cont b-blocker , and patient was started on coumadin - levels ( inr ) should be monitored .
Nutrition :
Patient should be started on tube feeds at rehab
Rash :
Patient developed a diffuse erythematous rash , though to be an ID reaction to a recent fungal infection .
She has been satrted on benadryl and hydrocort for sx relief .
Please monitor this ( may need dermatology consult ).
Also a drug reaction is in the ddx but unlikely as rash started at rehab prior to receiving drugs here .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
The patient is a 73 year old female who was transferred for cardiac catheterization after ventricular fibrillation arrest in the setting of an acute inferior myocardial infarction and a urinary tract infection . 
The patient was admitted on 3-16-93 to Diy Hospital for an E. coli urinary tract infection . 
The patient was readmitted on 3-20-93 because of fever , chills and a sudden onset of ventricular fibrillation arrest , successfully cardioverted back to rapid atrial fibrillation and finally to sinus rhythm , where an electrocardiogram then showed ST elevation in inferior leads . 
Peak CPK was 2494 with 18% MB 's . 
She required intubation for mild to moderate congestive heart failure , treated with diuretics , intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin . 
She had post-infarction angina , was transferred here for angiography and possible percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : 
On 3-27-93 , patient underwent cardiac catheterization , coronary and left ventricular angiography without complications . 
Review of these angiograms demonstrated a dominant right coronary artery with a focal 50% stenosis in the mid-portion . 
The left main coronary artery was clear . 
The left anterior descending had moderate plaques with a 50% proximal stenosis of the right anterior oblique caudal view . 
The proximal diagonal D1 had a 50% stenosis . 
The circumflex had a long 30% stenosis proximally and an 80% stenosis at the origin of the second major marginal artery . 
The left ventricular angiogram showed akinesis of the posterobasal walls , severe hypokinesis of the diaphragmatic wall and trace mitral regurgitation . 
The patient was maintained on heparin anticoagulation . 
An exercise tolerance test with Thallium was to be performed in order to assess myocardial viability in the infarct zone . 
The right coronary artery lesion was complex and there was severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal 1 . 
The patient had no further angina . 
On 4-2-93 , she underwent a Persantine Thallium study . 
This showed no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes for ischemia and no angina pectoris . 
The thallium images showed a large region of persistently reduced blood flow involving the apex and inferoposterior segments of the left ventricular wall . 
This was consistent with scar . 
There was no definite perfusion abnormality in the circumflex zone . 
In view of these findings , it was elected to discharge her on her present medical program . 
The patient is to return to the follow up care of Dr. Ko Kollciem at the Diy Hospital .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on 4/28/93 with progressive weakness , weight loss and shortness of breath .
The patient was in a good state of health until January of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue .
She had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months .
Although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving , her weakness persisted .
A work up begun by her internist , Dr. Brain , revealed a white blood cell count of 49,000 with 50% eosinophils .
She was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home for further evaluation .
Data collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable .
The liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303 , LDH 310 , SGOT 66 , albumin 2.5 .
A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers .
Chromosomal studies were negative .
A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area .
A thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass .
This was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst .
Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid .
An upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable .
The small bowel follow through was within normal limits .
A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side .
A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly .
The patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain .
She continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss .
She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion .
A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .
The patient reports no history of radiation exposure , no family history of thyroid carcinoma , no recent travels or exposure to tuberculosis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .
Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .
Accordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .
This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .
A lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .
During this time the patient &apos;s coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing .
ANCA serum results were negative .
ANA results were also nonsuggestive .
The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .
There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .
A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .
Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .
Meanwhile , the patient &apos;s eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .
She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .
The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .
Dr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .
On 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .
She underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .
She was received in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .
Her rate was well controlled on Digoxin .
The patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .
On the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy .
Calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .
She continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .
She continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .
Anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin .
She was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .
She also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .
She did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gait disorder .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31-year-old right-handed female with right-sided greater than left-sided weakness and difficulty walking for several days .
She was in her usual state of health until 3/20/97 when she experienced the fairly sudden onset of predominantly right-sided arm and leg weakness and ataxia .
She was standing and walking with her friend , who &quot; had to catch her from falling down &quot; as she toppled towards the right .
She evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .
The following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .
In the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of &quot; imbalance &quot; , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .
There was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .
She was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by Dr. Freiermchird of Nash Health for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .
Her Doxepin has recently been increased .
She is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .
ALLERGIES :
Quinine gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
The only medications she is on are Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.day , Doxepin 25 mg p.o. q.day , and Klonopin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.

She is currently unemployed , but until recently , she was employed at a bank .
She was born and raised in Atonlaremont Rockpo .
There is a history of childhood abuse .
She does not drink .
She is a former tobacco user and takes no illicit drugs .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was pleasant , in no acute distress ; blood pressure 130/60 ; heart rate 66 ; respirations 18 ; temperature 98 .
Her thyroid was within normal limits .
There were no carotid or cervical bruits .
She had a normal S1 and S2 and regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Her abdomen was benign .
Her extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis , edema , or rash ; there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .
Mental status - her speech was fluent without errors .
Her affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .
Her memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .
Visual fields were full to confrontation .
Her left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .
Her right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .
Her extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .
There was no nystagmus and no ptosis .
Her saccades were normal .
Facial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .
Her tongue , uvula and palate were midline .
Shoulder shrug was 5/5 power .
Motor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .
There was no drift .
There was normal bulk and tone .
She had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .
Sensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .
Reflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .
There was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman &apos;s sign .
Coordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .
On standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .
Her heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .
LABORATORY DATA :
Were unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .
Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .
Her coagulation parameters were normal .
Head CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient &apos;s report , had been noted several months earlier .
A magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .
She had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .
Posterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .
On the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .
She was seen by the Psychiatry Service .
She was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .
The psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .
The patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .
This trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .
She will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .
She will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 - year-old man with a history of hypertension and prior history of atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism who presented to an outside hospital with a history of left-sided chest pain at rest .
The patient awoke with chest pressure radiating to the right chest associated with diaphoresis .
The patient was found to have a blood pressure of 170/108 with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response to a heart rate of 140s .
The patient was rate controlled and transferred to the Stillman Infirmary for emergent cardiac catheterization .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred for cardiac catheterization .
Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 45% , right dominant coronary artery system with occlusive single vessel disease of the LAD .
Multiple wires were used to attempt to cross the total occlusion , but were ultimately unsuccessful .
The patient was continued on a heparin drip for atrial fibrillation .
Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation was obtained and the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2010-03-12 for coronary artery bypass grafting times two ; LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery .
Subsequent to this , the patient was transferred to the CRSU for closer monitoring .
He was deemed to be too lethargic and sleepy to be extubated on postoperative day number zero .
The patient was extubated early on postoperative day number one without significant complication .
He remained in atrial fibrillation .
The EP Service was consulted regarding the patient 's atrial fibrillation .
This was his main issue in the postoperative course .
He was attempted on multiple different drugs including Procainamide , Diltiazem , Esmolol , Sotalol , Amiodarone .
The patient was kept therapeutically anticoagulated throughout this period .
The patient was also started on digoxin .
Ultimately , the patient was transferred to the floor and anticoagulation with Coumadin was begun .
The patient arrived on the floor with medications as follows :
Sotalol 180 mg b.i.d. , Diltiazem 90 mg q.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
While the patient was awaiting therapeutic anticoagulation with Coumadin , he spontaneously converted into normal sinus rhythm .
The patient was found to have a resting heart rate of approximately 50 subsequent to this .
In consultation with the EP Service , Diltiazem was stopped .
After approximately 24 hours , the patient converted back into atrial fibrillation and Diltiazem was restarted at 60 mg q.i.d.
The patient then had one more episode where he was converted to normal sinus rhythm but this lasted only a few hours before reverting back to atrial fibrillation .
The patient was ultimately discharged on postoperative day number 16 , tolerating a regular diet , and adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications , having no anginal symptoms and with an INR of 2.0 .
The patient failed multiple attempts at cardioversion .
ADMISSION DATE :
10-24-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
11-2-93
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .
He was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q&apos;s in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.
On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .
The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .
He had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA &apos;d to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB&apos;s .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .
He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .
On day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .
On day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .
Therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .
The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .
However , he did not keep any of these appointments .
He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .
On the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .
He was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .
He was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .
No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .
This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA &apos;d , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .
The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .
Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .
He was ambulated progressively on the floor .
A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .
The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .
On 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .
This treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .
The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .
There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .
The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .
Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .
There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .
These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .
After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .
The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .
Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient &apos;s daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient &apos;s compliance .
Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .
The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .
She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .
The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .
Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .
He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .

He has had worsening dyspnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , though denies orthopnea .
No hemoptysis , no fevers , chills , sweats , when pneumonia resolved .
The patient also noticed a loss of weight of approximately 25 pounds over a few months with increased fatigue and lower extremity weakness .
A &quot; spot &quot; in the left lower lobe on chest X-ray was noted in October of 1993 , after his pneumonia cleared .
A follow up chest computerized tomography scan led to a tissue biopsy via flexible bronchoscopy in 11/93 .
Tissue returned well differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient was told nothing could be done until he was referred to Dr. An .
His appetite has been good and he has only complained of occasional sharp pain under his rib cage , right greater than left .
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to Percodan , which gives him itchiness .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :

HOSPITAL COURSE :
A quantitative V / Q scan was also done preoperatively and Pulmonary consult was obtained preoperatively .
Pulmonary recommended that he just be started on Albuterol and Atrovent metered dose inhalers , 2 puffs q6h , prior to surgery .
The patient underwent his procedure on 12-4-93 , without complications .
Findings included thickened pleura with multiple adhesions and an abscess near the margin major fissure .
He had a firm nodule in the left lower lobe .
The patient was transferred to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit in stable condition and had an uneventful stay there .
He had oxygen saturations of 99% with an Fi02 of 40% and had no complaints .
He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number one and tolerated his PO&apos;s well .
His left lower lobe micro results revealed alpha hemolytic Streptococcus on culture and he was then switched to penicillin and Gentamicin after being started on triples of Flagyl , Ampicillin , and Gentamicin .
He had low grade temperatures , though did not spike a high temperature during his hospital course .
His hospital course was otherwise uneventful and the patient was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day , afebrile .
The chest X-ray on the morning of discharge was unchanged from the previous day , with slight increase in left pleural fluid .
He had completed six days of penicillin and Gentamicin and was discharged on Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for the next seven days .
He stayed at the local Comfort Inn before his return back to Aujer Cin .

Her shortness of breath has been progressive over the last 2-3 years .
She has an associated dry cough but no fevers , chills , or leg pain .
She has dyspnea on exertion .
She ambulates with walker and a cane secondary to osteoarthritis .
She becomes short of breath just by getting up from her chair and can only walk 2-3 steps on a flat surface .
She feels light headed when getting up .
Her shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has been progressive for the past several years .
It has not been sudden or acute .
She sleeps in a chair up right for the last 2 1/2 years secondary to osteoarthritis .
She has orthopnea as well but noparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She occasionally feels chest twinges which are nonradiating but are sharp .
They last a few seconds on the left side and are not associated with sweating , nausea , vomiting or syncope .
She has had lower extremity edema for thelast several years with multiple episodes of cellulitis .
Her lower extremity edema has increased for the several weeks prior to admission secondary to an inability to elevate her legs due to a broken chair at home .
She denies any pleural chest pain .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Negative for headaches , vision changes , numbness , tingling , dyspnea , hematuria , abdominal pain , diarrhea , melena or hematochezia .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .
The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
On admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .
Her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , HDL32 , LDL 64 .
The patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .
It was unclear whether this was old or new .
A TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
Chest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .
The patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .
The cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .
Her blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .
She will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She is on an aspirin .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;
Pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .
Unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin .
An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .
Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .
She has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence .
She has episodes of not breathing .
BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
4. Hematology :
D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .
This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
It was a poor study .
Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Discharge INR 1.8 .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .

History of Present Illness :
This is an 85 year old female with prior history of non-hodgkins lymphoma , s/p Cytoxan in 2003 a with recurrence in 2009 .
Follow up examinations have found a suspicious left lower lobe finding .
Cardiac workup prior to left lower lobe resection led to cardiac catheterization which found severe three vessel disease with 04-05+ mitral regurgitation .
She now present for surgical intervention .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mrs. Mandelbaum was admitted and underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Larry Mckinney .
Of note , intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram evaluation showed only mild mitral regurgitation , so no repair/replacement was indicated .
Following the operation , she was brought to the CSRU .
On postoperative day one , she was noted to be largely unresponsive with left hemiparesis .
Restlessness with body tremors were also noted .
A stat MRI was notable for multiple abnormal foci consistent with systemic emboli .
These were found in the right cerebellar , occipital and anterior parietal lobes .
The neurology service was consulted and attributed these findings to cholesterol emboli .
Due to seizure activity , Dilantin was started .
Anticoagulation was not recommended .
Over the next several days , her neurological status slowly improved .
She was eventually extubated without incident .
She went on to experience paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which was initially treated with intravenous Amiodarone .
She concomitantly had loose stools which were C. diff negative .
Her clinical status stablized and she transferred to the step down unit on postoperative day six .
She remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm and transitioned to oral Amiodarone which will need to continue for three months postop .
She tolerated beta blockade which was slowly advanced as tolerated .
She worked daily with physical and occupational therapy .
Her neurological status continued to improve .
Acyclovir was eventually increased from her maintenance dose for a herpes zoster breakout on her right upper back .
In addition , she was empirically started on Flagyl for persistent diarrhea ( despite negative C. diff cultures ) , however she developed an additional rash on her buttocks after the first dose of flagyl , so the flagyl was discontinued .
She developed a urinary tract infection for which she was started on Bactrim .
A foley catheter was inserted given her mutiple episodes of incontinence that were adding to skin irritation .
On insertion she was found to be retaining 1400 cc of urine , so the foley catheter was left in .
She continued to make clinical improvements and was cleared for discharge to rehab on postoperative day 10 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Villesatelkscurb is a fifty year old black gentleman with a long history of hepatitis C , believed to be contracted during transfusions in a previous trauma .
The patient had recently prior to this admission , had a rise in his alpha feta protein and a biopsy of his liver had shown hepatocellular carcinoma .
The patient was admitted for liver transplant workup and to await liver transplant .
PAST MEDICAL and
SURGICAL HISTORY :
Significant for motor vehicle accident in 1966 , requiring exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy , tonsillectomy as a child , pneumonia in the past , hepatitis C and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission medications included Lasix and iron .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Preoperatively , the patient underwent chemo-embolization for his hepatocellular carcinoma .
The remainder of his preoperative course was benign .
On July 15 , 1992 , a liver became available , and the patient underwent hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant .
His operation was complicated by severe coagulopathy requiring fifty-nine units of packed red blood cells , 64 units of FFP and 34 units of platelets .
Postoperatively , the patient continued to have a coagulopathy requiring re-exploration on postoperatively day 2 , with findings only of hematoma and no active bleeding .
Initially , the patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit , mentally alert , and oriented , however , he continued to be coagulopathic and was requiring large amounts of blood and FFP transfusions , with a resultant pulmonary edema .
He developed renal failure felt to be ATN secondary to ischemia of his kidneys .
The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for twelve days prior to his death .
He had daily transfusions of FFP and blood , and continued coagulopathy .
He also developed thrombocytopenia , requiring persistent platelet transfusions on a daily basis .
His immunosuppression was OKT3 and Solu Medrol , and he underwent hemodialysis and ultra filtration to remove fluid .
While in the ICU he developed seizures , requiring large amounts of intravenous Valium to break his seizures , and he was maintained on Tegretol and Dilantin .
However , he became progressively more mentally obtunded .
During the seizure , he bit his tongue , resulting in a large bleed from his tongue , which was sutured by the ENT Service , however , his continued coagulopathy resulted in bleeding from his nasopharynx , which could never be identified , and also upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
Endoscopy never revealed specific sources of bleeding , although he appeared to have a diffuse duodenitis .
He was started on Pitressin to try to control the gastrointestinal bleeding , but he continued to have severe bleeding , and became progressively hypotensive , with eventual bradycardia and cardiac arrest .
He was pronounced dead at 3:49 PM on July 27 , 1992 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72-year-old right-handed gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in 1984 .
Also with a history of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus , now presenting with acute blurry vision on the left side , which is homonymous .
The patient woke up as usual on May 8 , 1995 .
At 8 a.m. the patient was looking at his wife with the background outside a large window .
The patient had sudden onset of blurred vision , where the right side of his wife &apos;s face looked blurred .
The patient did not notice change of vision in the background .
The blurred vision was homonymous , which he had blurred in each eye in the left visual field .
The same blurred vision was also noticed later when the patient was watching television and also when he was reading .
The patient was seen at the Ochtuheihugh Put University Medical Center and then he was referred to the Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital .
At 8 p.m. the patient seen at the Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital and was examined and assessed .
The patient was referred to Ph University Of Medical Center for rule out transient ischemic attack and rule out stroke .
The patient denies any nausea , vomiting , ataxia , motor deficits , speech deficits or sensory deficits .
The patient lightly bumped his head on the top three times on the previous night and the patient had frontal headaches and a tight neck .
One hour after he had physical activity on the previously night as well .
ALLERGIES :
The patient denies any drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a right occipital cerebral infarction .
The patient was started on intravenous heparin and had the studies as described above for rule out source of embolic strokes including carotid noninvasives , transcranial Dopplers , Holter electrocardiogram and echocardiogram .
The patient also had serial electrocardiogram , which showed no change .
The patient also had serial creatinine kinase with MB fractions studied , which revealed MB fraction too low to be tested .
The patient also experienced a feeling of moving back and forth when lying down with neck extended during the magnetic resonance imaging study and also in bed .
This moving sense , with normal electroencephalogram , was thought to be a mild vestibular dysfunction or from the acute episode of the stroke .
The patient will have these symptoms only when the eyes are closed .
Our opinion was not to intervene or have any further studies for acute period and to continued to observe .
The patient did have a hypotensive episode and the systolic blood pressure was 80 , after the patient received his regular cardiac medications .
The patient had been off his regular medications since during the admission and will be discharged off his medications .
Otherwise , there were no further episodes of blurred vision .
The patient was stable with an unchanged neurological and physical examination and was discharged on aspirin 325 mg po qd , on May 14 , 1995 .
The patient will be randomized on the Wars study early next week by the Stroke Service at Ph University Of Medical Center .

Chest x-ray was remarkable for a questionable left lower lobe infiltrate .
The patient received nebulizer treatment with oxygen saturations increasing up to 98 percent on room air .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Shortness of breath .
The patient was maintained on albuterol nebulizer treatments and Ipratropium nebulizer treatments , as this was apparently thought to be related to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Given the presence of consolidation on chest x-ray , however , and previous history of pneumonia , the patient was maintained on antibiotics of Zithromax 500 mg daily and ceftriaxone .
The patient was also started on Solu-Medrol IV for active airway disease component of her shortness of breath .
The patient was maintained on supplemental oxygen and sputum production was maximized with the help of an Acapella device and respiratory therapy .
Mucomyst was also considered as a mucolytic component towards secretions .
Adrenal insufficiency .
The patient was maintained on IV Solu - Medrol 60 mg q. 8 h.
Chest soreness .
The patient describes chest discomfort without any significant EKG changes .
The patient was maintained on Percocet p.r.n. for pain relief .
This was thought to be related to musculoskeletal .
There was no evidence of acute rib factors on her chest x-ray .
GI .
The patient was maintained on PPI for reflux disease and known gastritis .
CMED .
The patient has a history of neurogenic bladder and , therefore , she required a Foley catheterization .
Endocrine .
The patient was on Levoxyl at home as her home dose for hyperthyroidism .
CMED CSRU transfer .
The patient was transferred on the evening of 2012-05-22 to the ICU given persistent carbon dioxide retention and respiratory acidosis and the intermittent mental status changes .
The patient had had ABG on the floor , which prompted her to transfer to the ICU .
Her pH was 7.23 , PCO2 73 , PO2 146 on a nonrebreather .
The patient had BiPAP initiated once she reached the unit , but did not tolerate it , becoming apneic and obstructing .
The patient was switched to 2 liters nasal cannula and oxygen saturating at 98 to 100 percent .
After BiPAP was initiated , the patient became hypotensive down to 75/28 and bradycardiac , responding to 3 fluid boluses over the course of the night .
The patient was started on Florinef for concern of adrenal insufficiency ; however , she was hemodynamically stable that morning and was transferred back out to the floor .
It was thought that the patient may have been mucous plugging during her stay in the ICU .
Hematologic .
The patient has a history of high MCV and megaloblastic cells on smear in the setting of anemia ; question B12 deficiency , the patient also has a history of borderline low B12 levels .
The patient was diagnosed for B12 deficiency due to her long history of poor p.o. intake .
Methylmalonic acid levels were sent , the results are pending at the time of discharge .

DISCHARGE DATE :
10-10-94
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 60 year old diabetic who underwent an APR in 1989 for rectal carcinoma and has been doing following radiation therapy and 5FU .
He recently developed fatigue and dyspnea and workup disclosed a large liver mass which was biopsied and revealed to be poorly differentiated neoplasm most consistent with metastatic rectal discontinued .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and underwent celiac and superior mesenteric artery angiography which demonstrated a patent celiac and superior mesenteric artery with normal branching pattern .
His preoperative workup was completed and included a normal white count , hematocrit 42 .
normal electrolytes , normal coags and normal renal function .
On 10-02-94 the patient was brought to the operating room where he underwent exploratory laparotomy and left hepatectomy and cholecystectomy by Dr. Duhenile .
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a 2000 cc. blood loss and was autotransfused two units of blood .
In the postoperative course Mr. Fyfe did surprisingly well given his underlying medical condition . ,
He did require two units of transfused blood but otherwise did quite well and was extubated on the night of surgery .
He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for two days but was hemodynamically stable throughout .
He continued to manifest occasional premature ventricular contractions , but these were unchanged from preoperatively and the patient otherwise did well .
His nasogastric tube was discontinued and he was begun on clear liquids and subsequently advanced to a regular diet without difficulty .
Both of his Jackson-Pratt drains were removed without incident .
By postoperative day # 7 , Mr. Fyfe was tolerating a regular ADA 1800 kilocalorie diet without difficulty with all of his tubes and drains removed .
His wound was noted to be healing well and his colostomy functioning appropriately without significant difficulty .

Admission Date :
2013-08-24
Discharge Date :
2013-08-27
Service :
Trauma Surgery
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 25 - year-old gentleman who is status post a motor vehicle accident in which he was the unrestrained driver and struck a telephone pole .
He was ejected from the car and landed on his face .
Extreme damage was reported to the vehicle by first responders .
It was presumed high-speed motor vehicle collision .
The patient was CMED-flighted to Quincy Medical Center , and he was intubated upon arrival in the Emergency Department .
After initial trauma assessment and initiation of resuscitation , a CT scan was performed .
Images of his head , abdomen , and thorax were obtained .
His injuries included bilateral zygomal and orbital rim fractures , a right temporal fracture , bilateral frontal contusions , and a right temporal epidural versus subdural hematoma .
The anterior and posterior of the frontal sinus was fractured with communication with the ethmoid air cells , presumably caused air in the orbit .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. NEUROLOGY :
Mr. Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay .
Upon arrival , Neurosurgery promptly placed V. Holtzen bolt .
This allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure .
Notably , intracranial pressure was 17 when the bolt was placed .
During his hospitalization , his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than 20 .
To do this , mannitol 25 mg q. 6h. was used .
While using mannitol , his serum osmolalities were followed closely .
In addition , to monitoring his intracranial pressure , his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg .
A parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO2 which was maintained between 35 and 40 during his hospitalization .
Mr. Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and / or morphine boluses for pain .
Neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination .
During his hospitalization , two subsequent CAT scans were obtained ; one on hospital day two .
This CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed .
After a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery , the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant , and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition .
His intracranial pressure remained stable , and his clinical examination was unchanged .
An additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three .
This examination was unchanged from the previous examination .
Again , his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same , and conservative treatment was opted for .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
As described in previous section , Neo-Synephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70 .
A pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four .
This catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support .
Please see Infectious Disease section for more details .
3. GASTROINTESTINAL :
Mr. Roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission .
A orogastric tube was passed .
Initially during admission , carafate was given down the orogastric tube .
However , on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three , a mediastinum was noted .
This raised the question of potential esophageal rupture .
Gastroenterology was consulted for this .
Gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status .
At this point , his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly n.p.o.
4. HEMATOLOGY :
Throughout Mr. Richard admission , his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s .
As will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section , he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis , and his white blood cell count peaked at 23 .
Mr. Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis .
He was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage .
An inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred , as it was felt that Mr. Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure .
5. ENDOCRINE :
Mr. Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale .
6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
Mr. Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers .
His blood urine and sputum were all cultured .
Blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram - positive coagulase - negative Staphylococcus which grew from 08-25 .
His preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew Escherichia coli .
Sputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods , not yet speciated , and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1+ gram-negative rods and 4+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes .
Throughout this time , Mr. Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four , his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade .
During his hospitalization , his was treated with vancomycin for his gram-negative rods , imipenem , and Flagyl .
Initially , he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain , but his cultures became positive , and his white blood cell count increased .
He was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl .
Vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture .
With a fever of 102 , up to 42 degrees centigrade , aggressive measures including cooling blankets , alcohol swabs , and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down .
Hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion , paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering .
7. PULMONARY :
As discussed in the Infectious Disease section , Mr. Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms , but most likely from Escherichia coli .
For this pneumonia , he was placed empirically on imipenem , vancomycin , and Flagyl .
On hospital day three , Mr. Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea .
For this , a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism .
On hospital day four , a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax .
For this , a left #34 Caucasian chest tube was placed .
On the evening of hospital day four , Mr. Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole .
Urgent resuscitation measures were initiated .
The measures included attempts at pacing .
Epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium .
He had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax , cardiac tamponade , and pulmonary embolism .
During the resuscitation afterwards , it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest , so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest .
There was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression , and a right chest tube was placed .
During this time , a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back .
A left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present .
After 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage , there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors .
Resuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27 .
After the termination of resuscitation , both the anesthesia Intensive Care Unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient 's family members including his next of kin , his mother .
Permission for a postmortem examination was granted .

MRI , as discussed , was done at outside hospital and demonstrated large ventricles .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Arkzie- Memorial for lumbar puncture .
On the night of admission lumbar puncture was attempted on the floor , but we were unable to get cerebral spinal fluid due to difficulty with compliance with the patient who was severely agitated and would not comply with the examination .
On hospital day the patient underwent conscious sedation in the operating room where lumbar puncture was performed .
Opening pressure was 17 and approximately 20-25 cc of CSF was removed .
CSF was notable for sugar level of 65 and total protein level of 56 .

DISCHARGE DATE :
4-2-94
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 &apos;s .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient &apos;s family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
Admission Date :
02/08/1990
Discharge Date :

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 43-year-old gravida II para II white female referred by Dr. Ca Shuff for evaluation .
She was in her usual state of good health until December when she was seen emergently for treatment of a perforated colon cancer .
That area was resected with no evidence of metastatic disease .
She has had subsequent CEA&apos;s and scans which were negative .
A tumor was noted on her vulva which was biopsied and revealed squamous cell carcinoma in situ .
ALLERGIES :
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
MEDICATIONS :
None .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
As above with colostomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The plan was for right radical vulvectomy .
1. Vulvectomy :
The patient on 2/8/90 underwent a right radical vulvectomy with excellent results and negative margins on frozen section .
Her postoperative course was unremarkble .
She was kept on bedrest for two days and then was ambulating and voiding well without trouble on postoperative day number three when the Foley catheter was discontinued .
She has been doing Betadine paint and blow drying the area several times a day and after each bowel movement and urine without incident .

DISCHARGE DATE :
10-06-94
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 85 year old man was admitted because of the new onset of focal left-sided seizure and unresponsiveness .
He had a past history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10 , mild aortic stenosis and a right middle cerebral artery territory stroke in 07/94 .
He was at Orlak on the day of admission and was found unresponsive with left tonic-clonic movements , greater in the arms than in the legs .
He was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , where seizures were stopped with 2 mg of Ativan .
He was loaded with IV Dilantin .
He remained unresponsive with poor airway protection .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Eyes were deviated to the left .
He was flaccid bilaterally .
He had no oculocephalic reflexes .
After one hour his eyes were midline and he remained unresponsive .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By the patient and his family &apos;s prior wishes , the patient was extubated .
An electroencephalogram revealed generalized slowing without ictal events .
He had no carotid bruits .
He had stertorous breathing , positional tremors of the left upper extremity , a spastic left hemiparesis in flexion .
He withdrew both legs to painful stimuli .
The right upper extremity was flaccid and paresthetic .
Again , comfort measures only were undertaken as per the patient &apos;s previous wishes and the family &apos;s current insistence .
At 1:15 PM on 10/06/94 , the patient was found unresponsive with no heart sounds , carotid pulse , respiratory excursions , or pupillary reactions .
His family was notified .
Consent for autopsy was denied .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Stain was transferred from the Oreiewlefell Merkane I Penaltbridgesgreat University Medical Center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis .
His only positive result was a sputum culture for Pseudomonas and this came after he had already been on antibiotics .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it .
He also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky .
The patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas he was known to have .
The steroids were tapered .
He was also begun on anti-Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen .
Because of the story of hemoptysis , he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner &apos;s and Goodpasture &apos;s .
These results were all negative .
He continued to require very high FIO2 .
He was found to have a DVT by ultrasound .
He underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin .
This produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion .
He stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement .
In consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done .
At that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 58 year old female with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease for more than twenty years who presented to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center with a revolving anterolateral wall myocardial infarction on 08-01-93 .
She has been under the care of Dr. Aalv Manual and was referred here for further therapy .
She had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor &apos;s office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain .
Her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .
The patient was transferred to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center and was admitted .
Her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .
In addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 .
She developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support .
She underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .
She had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease .
The main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .
The left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .
The circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis .
Cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .
The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .
The patient was transferred to the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for consideration of coronary angioplasty .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Department because of the history of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
The patient was maintained on intravenous heparin .
On 8-17-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending .
Following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty .
Therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
She was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 08-18-93 for a relook coronary angiography .
Coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy .
Specifically , there was no decrease in the initial gain that she achieved after directional atherectomy .
The patient remained stable during the rest of the hospitalization .
She was transferred in stable condition to the Pasi for further rehabilitation therapy .

Brief Hospital Course :
BRIEF OVERVIEW :
57 yo F with h/o polyglandular autoimmune syndrome initially admitted in May to FICU for suicide overdose then transferred to Whittier Rehab Hospital 4 for depression , who was transferred to the medical floor for a syncopal episode and hypotension to 60 systolic that returned to baseline with 2.5L IVF who was subsequently transferred to the CMED CSRU for a recurrent episode of hypotension , fevers and concern for sepsis .
Initially when she arrived to the floor she was afebrile , normotensive without signs of orthostasis , had a negative UA , a clear chest xray and no signs / symptoms of a fever .
She was slightly tachycardic .
She was initially not started on antibiotics .
She was given a standing IVF order .
Overnight she became febrile to 102.3 , increasingly tachycardic to 125 , and hypotensive to 80 systolic .
She was started on stress dose steroids and levo , flagyl , and vanco .
She was given 4L of fluid boluses and transfered to the CMED CSRU .
In the CMED CSRU , repeated attempts to place lines were unsuccessful .
The above treatments were continued .
Urine cultures returned with 10-100,000 organisms coag negative staph .
Blood cultures remained negative .
Vital signs stabilized and she was transfered back to the medical floor after 2 days in the ICU .
Stress dose steroids were planned for a 7 day course , antibiotics were peeled back to levofloxacin alone , and a R hip film revealed no loosening nor inflammation .
Echo showed normal function , trace AR , and no MR .
She had a normal RUQ US , as well .
On the floor the patient remained stable hemodynamically without recurrent fever and was stable for transfer back to Franciscan Children 's Hospital & Rehab Center 4 .
At the time of discharge , her potassium had been low despite repletion , Na was elevated , as was blood pressure .
On recommendation from endocrine , her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 ( higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms . ) .
1. Hypotension :
Patient presented after episode of hypotension and syncope on Mass. Mental Health Center 5 .
Initially it was felt that this was a result of poor PO intake .
She was afebrile without orthostatic vital signs nor hypotension .
She had no symptoms of infectious source , normal UA , normal chest xray , and no symptoms nor signs of injury after her fall with syncope .
Neuro exam was normal .
Subsequently overnight , she developed a fever to 102.3 and recurrent hypotension in the setting of fevers and tachycardia that was concerning for an infectious source .
She still had no localizing signs of infection and culture data was negative to be negative .
RUQ US was ordered and returned without signs of infection later .
She was started on stress dose steroids .
She had cultures drawn , was given tylenol ( tylenol screen prior to this dose was negative , as was a urine tox ) , was started on levofloxacin , metronidazole , and vancomycin to cover emperically for hospital aquired pneumonia , GI sources , and a potential hip infection .
Her transaminases were slightly elevated , which was later attributed to shock liver as a result of her period of hypotension .
Lipase and amylase remained normal .
In the ICU she also received an echo that revealed normal function and little valvular disease ( she has two loud systolic murmurs on exam ) , and a hip film revealing no inflammation nor loosening .
Urine culture twice grew 10-100,000 coag negative staph .
A line could not be placed for technical reasons , however after 4L NS on the floor and 01-30 more in the ICU via peripheral IV 's she was stable .
She remained hemodynamically stable with good UOP in the setting of being started on abx and stress dose steroids .
The steroids were thought to have helped significantly in in the setting of Addison 's with possibely superimposed infection .
The patient was planned for a 7 day course of stress dose steroids followed by a return to her basal predinisone / fludrocortisone dose .
2. Elevated LFTs :
LFTs wre elevated at presentation .
Initially the differential was thought to include shock liver from hypotension , hepatitis , cholangitis or choledocholithiasis .
Hepatitis serologies were negative and the pt was eventually felt to have had shock liver from her hypotensive episode as the transaminitis resolved over time .
3. Hypoparathyroidism :
This is a chronic problem .
calcium levels were followed with a goal to keep them around 8.0 by continuing Calcium carbonate , calcitriol .
The pt required calcium gluconate x1 the day prior to discharge .
Per endocrine at the time of discharge , the pt may need an increase in calcium PO , but at this time they recommended no change .
It will need to be monitored over time .
4. Addison 's- The patient is on basal prednisone / fludrocortisone .
These were initially continued as above and later , when she became hypotensive and febrile , stress dose steroids were started and planned for a 7 day course followed by a return to her prior dose of prednisone .
At the time of discharge , her potassium had been low despite repletion ,
Na was elevated , as was blood pressure .
On recommendation from endocrine , her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 ( higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms. ) .
5. DM :
Light followed the patient .
She was continued on her prior dose of steroids with sliding scale per patient using a 1:15 carb counting scheme with a 1:30 correction factor .
On the day of discharge her glargine was decreased by one unit because her glucose remained somewhat low in the mornings .
6. R Hip pain :
Later in her hospital course , the pt complained of hip pain .
A R hip film was negative for pathology or failure of her hip replacement .

Mr. Mcelveen is a 51 year-old male with metastatic RCC status post left radical nephrectomy in 2018-03-21 , status post Avastin and sorafenib , most recently on Sutent monotherapy since 2018-12-21 , with mild renal insufficiency , who presented from home on 2019-06-14 with shortness of breath and fever .
Of note , he was hospitalized at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 9/25-10/6 with chest pain , at which time he reportedly had cardiac enzymes , an echocardiogram and a pharmacological stress test performed .
It is unclear from history what these studies revealed .
He reports that he felt fatigued during the week prior to the current admission .
On the day of admission , he felt " congested " in his chest , and had a new fever .
He was taken to the Deanna by his wife .
Patrick reports a mild cough for 2 days PTA , non-productive .
He denies a history of aspiration events or choking with food intake .
He describes mild reflux symptoms at night .
Further ROS reveals mild SOB in the days preceding admission , but he tells me that he was surprised to find out about his low oxygen saturation because he did not feel that bad .
He denies chills , no chest pain , no LE swelling .
In the Deanna , Tmax 102.8 , BP 100 - 140/60 s, HR 80 s, RR 20 s, Sat 75% on RA in triage , up to 100% on NRB .
CXR with bibasilar consolidations .
He was given Levo 750 mg PO X1 , and Flagyl 500 mg PO X1 .
His BP decreased to 100 systolic despite hydration with 2L of NS .
He was subsquently admitted to the ICU for further care .
He was placed on Levo and Ceftriaxone .
A cosyntropin stimulation test revealed cortisol 32.1 --> 36.4 .
His oxygen requirement decreased , and his overall status improved quickly .
He is being transferred to the floor for ongoing care .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Mcelveen 51 year-old male with metastatic RCC on Sutent since 2018-12-21 , admitted with fever , hypoxemia , and bibasilar pneumonia .
1) Bibasilar pneumonia : Patient was treated for community-acquired pneumonia .
He was initially placed on Ceftriaxone , Levaquin , and Flagyl in the ICU but then changed to 
Azithromycin & CTX at time of transfer to the oncology service .
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and CT scan suggested ground glass opacities , suggestive of an underlying infectious process .
ECHO was done and confirmed normal ejection fraction .
His respiratory status improved slowly , oxygen was weaned off , and he was discharged on course of Levaquin .
2) Metastatic RCC : Sutent was held on admission in light of acute infection .
He underwent a staging CT scan torso which suggested no significant increase in tumor burden .
Patient was also found to have abnormal TFTs on Sutent and was started on replacement therapy .
He will need follow-up bloodwork as an outpatient .
Recent CT scan showed destruction of L femoral neck .
He underwent an xray of the L femur which did not suggest an acute fracture .
No limitations were placed in regards to weightbearing status .
Patient was instructed to restart Sutent next Monday .
3) Renal insufficiency : Creatinine improved from 2.1 to 1.3 at time of discharge .
Likely related to underlying malignancy as well as prerenal component given improvement with gentle hydration .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52-year-old right handed male with a many year history of bilateral shoulder pain , right greater than left .
He has steroid injections in the right and in the left four times .
Arthrogram in the distant past showed a right rotator cuff tear and he now has increased pain in his left shoulder .
MRI by report showed bilateral rotator cuff repairs and he was admitted for repair of the left rotator cuff .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the assessment of left rotator cuff repair and he was taken to the Operating Room on the day of admission where he underwent left rotator cuff repair under general endotracheal tube anesthesia .
There were no intraoperative complications .
His postoperative course was generally unremarkable except for a prolonged course of advancement with range of motion of his left shoulder .
Occupational therapy became involved initially and he remained on patient controlled analgesia secondary to problems with left shoulder pain .
He was kept in the hospital for an extended period to improve his postoperative range of motion .
However , he was eventually able to achieve forward flexion of 135 degrees and external rotation of 30 degrees by postoperative day number eight .
His wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .
However , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and Endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .
His hemoglobin A1C levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .
He was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .
It was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .
He also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus Neurology was consulted and EMG &apos;s were performed which were normal .
His neurologist was contacted , Dr. Cap , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .
Further work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .
Thus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good condition with a well healed left shoulder wound and doing well with occupational therapy with plans for him to follow-up with Dr. Necessary .

Discharge Date :
03/08/1999
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Prehekote is an 88-year-old Portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 .
He received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention .
After that , he was on Lupron and Nilandron hormone therapy .
The patient was admitted on February 23 , 1999 to Eifro Medical Center because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit .
He was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine .
BUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .
Prostate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .
Further evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .
Because of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on February 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .
However after the procedure , the patient &apos;s hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .
His hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .
He also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .
Due to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from Eifro Medical Center to the Retelk County Medical Center for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries .
The patient was transferred to Genearocktemp Ry Health on March 3 , 1999 .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The patient had constipation with dysuria , but no fever or chills .
No cough .
No chest pain .
No palpitations , history of epigastric pain and body weight loss .
No headache .
No bone pain .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient .
The specialist concluded that because the patient &apos;s hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient &apos;s kidney .
Urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve .
After admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis .
He was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .
After transfusion , the patient &apos;s hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .
The patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .
He continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .
During this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .
CPK was tracked , but was totally normal .
No beta blockers were given .
A long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .
Dr. Lucreamull discussed the patient &apos;s clinical status and overall situation with the patient &apos;s family and the family decided that Mr. Prehekote could return home with hospice .
The patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles will manage the hospice issues .
The patient was discharged to home for hospice on March 8 , 1999 .
Admission Date :
05/09/1998
Discharge Date :
05/25/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74-year-old woman , well known to the cardiac surgery service , readmitted from Glasmif/putdi Health Network with sternal wound infection .
She has been previously hospitalized on 12 April 1998 for the same diagnosis .
She is now coming for surgical treatment , wound debridement , and possible wound closure with bilateral pectoralis flap .
She underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two with saphenous vein graft on 29 March 1998 .
Of note , the patient is status post lymphoma with treatment of chemotherapy and radiation six years ago , and is an insulin-dependent diabetic .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was placed on IV antibiotics , Ancef 1 gm q.8h.
On 10 May 1998 , she underwent sternal wound debridement and closure , performed by Dr. Falccouette and Dr. Shuffzeln .
The patient was switched to ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycin , according to the culture , Enterococci and Staphylococcus in the wound .
Due to the persistent fevers , the patient underwent vancomycin desensitization in the surgical Intensive Care Unit followed by a change of antibiotics to vancomycin and levofloxacin .
Further cultures from sputum and urine revealed yeast sensitive to Diflucan , which was administered shortly after .
Because of expected long term antibiotic administration , a PICC line was placed and the patient was prepared for transfer back to Fo Hospital .
As a small complication , the patient opened a left ankle wound post saphenous vein harvest , which persists up until now and is of a size 2 x 1 cm .
Due to difficult ambulation , the patient developed a small ulcer in the sacral area , which was treated with Duoderm dressing .
During the course of hospitalization , the patient was followed by cardiac surgery , cardiology , infectious disease , allergy , and medicine , including GI teams .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .
He underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .
In 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
A workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .
He has been on Decadron since 08/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .
He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .
There was evidence of cord compression .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to Lorough Medical Center &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .
In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .
ADMISSION DATE :
06-06-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
06-07-93
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 68 year old male status post three and a half cycles of adjuvant EAP chemotherapy .
He had a good response to preoperative therapy and negative nodes , and is admitted for the final portion of his postoperative cycles .
His chemotherapy the week before was decreased because the white blood count dropped to 2.8 .
In the interim , the white blood count rose again to 4.2 with a hematocrit of 30.5 , platelet count of 196 thousand .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was treated with Adriamycin 25 mg , Cis-platinum 40 mg , preceded by Mannitol 12.5 grams intravenous bolus , and Zofran 11 mg on two occasions given as an antiemetic .
The chemotherapy was well tolerated .
Admission Date :
2017-06-16
Discharge Date :
2017-07-27
Service :
MEDICINE
History of Present Illness :
Patient is a 58 year old male with a recent admission for abdominal pain s/p negative exploratory laparotomy for suspected intussuception now returns on day of discharge with fever and tachycardia .
Patient has a history for terrible vasculopathy s/p recent right BKA with dry gangrene of the distal stump .
Patient 's last admission was significant for a negative ex-lap .
Post-operatively , his course was complicated by respiratory distress necessitating an urgent return to the ICU and was intubated .
After multuple failed attempts at extubation , the patient was trached .
Patient then did well on a trach mask and was transferred to rehab on the day of admission but now returns with tachycardia to the 120 's , and fever to 102 degrees F .
Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was re-admitted to the surgical service and taken to the CMED .
A chest x-ray on admission showed effusions consistent with CHF along with overlying pnumonia .
Urine cultures were significant for Klebsiella UTI and sputum cultures were significant for MRSA .
He was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacin and fluconazole .
He underwent PICC line placement on 06-18 .
A trach collar was placed on 06-19 .
GI was consulted for colonoscopy .
Patient was transferred to the floor on 06-20 .
He was seen by respiratory therapy and suctioned continually throughout his hospital course .
His respiratory status improved .
He tolerated his trach collar , and tube feeds at goal .
The fluconazole was discontinued .
On 06-21 the patient was seen by physical therapy .
A nutrition consult was obtained on 06-22 .
He underwent a failed bedside swallow study .
Based on a chest x-ray that showed a small hydro-pneumothorax on the left lower lobe of the lung , a thoracic surgery consult was obtained , though no specific interventions were warranted at the time .
On 06-23 the patient 's tube feed were changed from Respalor to Deliver 2.0 to give increased calories .
On 06-25 , urine cultures grew out VRE , and a C diff was negative .
He experienced low grade fevers .
He was pan-cultured on 06-26 for continued fevers .
On 06-27 , his nutrition regimen was changed to Deliver 2.0 at 70 cc / hr with 15 g ProMod .
On 06-28 , the patient experienced PVC 's .
An EKG showed ST segment depression along the lateral pre-cordial leads .
Serial enzymes showed mild elevation of troponins .
A cardiology consult was obtained .
The cardiology service simply recommended increasing the beta-blockade and maximizing the patient 's electrolyte status .
On 06-29 , the patient was transferred to the medical service .
Pt 's vancomycin was stopped after 14 days of treatment .
HIV test was found to be negative .
MRI head was obtained to further w/u patient 's apparent cognitive decline .
MRI showed prominent sulci and enlarged ventricles abnormal for the patient 's age .
Due to concerns for dementia , neurology consult was obtained .
Neurology felt that the patient 's cognitive symptoms were consistent w/ metabolic encephalopathy due to his multiple medical problems .
They felt that his mental status would improve as his health improved .
Underlying dementia was possible but difficult to assess with an overlying delerium .
The patient continued to pull out his doboff tube .
Pt had EGD performed to evaluate his poor nutritional status .
He was found to have a large gastric ulcer and high dose PPI was started .
The gastric biopsy and the serology were both negative for H. pylori .
PEG placement was unsuccessful by GI due to the patient 's anantomy .
07-05 the patient had a J tube placed in interventional radiology for nutritional support .
He was re-started on tube feeds .
07-06 patient failed a repeat swallow evaluation due to discoordinated swallow .
07-07 the patient was taken for colonoscopy and found to have a normal colon to cecum .
07-12 the patient was found to be C diff positive and was started on 14 day course of Flagyl .
On 07-18 , as his mental status improved , he did well at the bed side swall evaluation .
On 07-19 , he underwent video swallow evaluation and was able to tolerate ground consistent food and thin liquids .
His meds should be crushed and mixed with puree thick liquid .
He has gained 30 lb since the tubefeed was initiated ( 70 lb to 100 lb ) during this admission .
He will still need to be on tubefeed to support his nutrition until he is cleared by a nutritionist .
In terms of his mental status , he continued to improve steadily over the last few weeks of his hospital stay .
He was more alert and engaged with activity .
He did much better with PT and OT at the end after his mental status improved .
As noted above , his mental status change was likely toxic-metabolic from acute infection .
He started to develop more pain around the right stump since 07-17 .
He was seen by the vascular surgery who felt that he is too medically sick and malnourished to have surgery at this time .
He will follow up with Dr. Javier as outpatient .
Initially , his pain was controlled with titrating up the Oxycontin .
However , it was titrated too quickly from 10 mg bid to 30 mg bid .
He then developed urinary retention requiring foley placement .
After he passed the video swallowing , he was tolerating ground consistent solids .
On 07-24 , he had an emesis x 1 , and had aspiration pneumonia ( + interstital markings on the left on CXR , fever , leukocytosis ) .
His Flagyl course was extended , and Vanc / Levo were added .
His sputum showed many GPC which later grew Staph aureus .
Given his recent MRSA pneumonia , he will be treated with 2 week course of Vanc / Levo / Flagyl .
He was seen by the pain service who recommended to discontinue Oxycontin , and start Neurontin , MSIR , and lidocaine patch in addition to the standing Tylenol .
On 07-25 , his J-tube was noted to be obstructed but was able to be flushed by IR on 07-26 .
Tubefeed was resumed without any difficulty since .
Since oxycontin was discontinued , the foley was removed on 07-27 and was able to void without any difficulty .
ADMISSION DATE : 
12/25/96 
DISCHARGE DATE : 
12/29/96 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
Ms. Lenkpruskihkooglekih is a 63-year-old lady with a history of frequent premature ventricular contractions and infrequent short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ( one four-beat run ) in 1991 , for which several antiarrhythmic agents including Propranolol , Quinidine , Procainamide , Tenormin , Norpace , Corgard , and Flecainide were used , but were stopped because of intolerance . 
At that time , she had clear coronary arteries on coronary angiography and an ejection fraction greater than 50% . 
She did well off antiarrhythmic agents until October of this year when she was noted to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate after several days of decreased exercise tolerance . 
She was started on Coumadin and had a failed attempt at DC electrical cardioversion on 11/16/96 . 
She has been on Coumadin since and has continued to have occasional palpitations and mild shortness of breath . 
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT : 
The patient was started on Propafenone 300 mg three times a day and underwent an attempt at electrical cardioversion after seven doses of this . 
This failed , despite one shock at 300 joules and two shocks at 360 joules . 
The Propafenone was stopped , and the patient was changed to Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. , which was continued for two days . 
The patient was discharged to home on Amiodarone 200 mg daily on 12/29/96 . 
An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of QT prolongation prior to discharge , and pulmonary function tests will be performed before the patient goes home today . 
The patient will follow up with Dr. Ther Ludzjesc at Shiekeu Hospital Medical Centers in Connecticut . 
In addition , she will return to this hospital in early February for repeat attempt at electrical cardioversion on Amiodarone . 
She will continue her Coumadin until then and arrangements for her readmission can be made through Dr. Iceca Rhaltkaaispehbreun 's office here . 
MEDICATIONS : 
Other than the addition of Amiodarone 200 mg daily , will be the same as her admission medications .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 84 year old male , with a history of hypertension , who was discovered to have an asymptomatic 7 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm on CT scan obtained in the emergency room back in May .
At that time he had presented with abdominal pain , and was found to have acute cholecystectomy .
He underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy .
He presents at this time for endovascular repair of this abdominal aortic aneurysm .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Vascular Surgery Service as a same day admission , and taken to the operating room for an uncomplicated endovascular repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm , and Anurx modular bifurcated graft was placed , and both common femoral arteries were repaired in the usual fashion .
He had pulsatile pulse volume recordings , in both lower extremities , and both renal arteries were noted to be patent , as were both internal iliac arteries .
His angiogram in the operating room , revealed no evidence of an endo leak .
Postoperatively , his course was relatively uncomplicated .
He did have an episode of a prolonged sinus pause in the recovery room , which resulted in transient loss of consciousness .
He responded to a Neo-Synephrine bolus , and had no further complications from this standpoint .
Dr. Rosean Fletcher , of the Cardiology Department was consulted , and it was his opinion that the sinus pause was related to increased vagal tone postoperatively , perhaps secondary to the epidural , as well as the patient &apos;s Atenolol use .
His Atenolol was held , and he had no further pauses during his stay .
His postoperative CT scan showed no evidence of endo leak , or graft kinking .
He maintained good peripheral pulses and warm feet postoperatively .
However , he did develop significant ecchymosis in both groins , extending down into his scrotum .
There was no evidence of significant groin hematomas .
He tolerated a regular diet .
His pain was adequately controlled with oral medications .
Accordingly , the patient was discharged to home on postoperative day 2 .
He will be visited by LDAMC for blood pressure and incision checks .
He will follow up with Dr. Dye in the Clinic .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical problems and known transfusion dependent secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome admitted with decreased hematocrit .
The patient has had multiple previous admissions for cardiac and pulmonary disease .
He has had chronic anemia since 1990 , but a bone marrow biopsy in 07-92 , was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome .
Over the past several months , the patient has had increasing transfusing requirements .
His transfusions have been complicated by fluid overload and congestive heart failure , secondary to ischemia cardiomyopathy .
His last admission was 9-14-93 , for a transfusion without complications , and prior to admission the patient reports having several days of increasing weakness , dizziness and fatigue .
His wife says his hands and lips have been blue .
Apparently , he had had a low hematocrit as an outpatient and was checked two weeks prior to admission but was not given transfusion because the patient did not want to come in at that time .
Aside from the above , the patient had felt that baseline without fever and chills or change in chronic cough .
He had no increase in his congestive heart failure symptoms , no chest pain , and no hemoptysis or changed in arthritis .
The patient did report taking a po antibiotic ( Ciprofloxacin ) for right great toe infection ( question of cellulitis vs. paronychia ) .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .
He was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .
Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units .
The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 &apos;s range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .
He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &apos;s after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .
His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 .
The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .
It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his LDH was within normal limits .
In addition , multiple stools were guaiaced and were all guaiac negative .
The patient was discharged with follow-up with his Hematologist , Dr. Eci Area and Rheumatologist , Dr. Taange Peter , and Cardiologist , Dr. Peter .

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 year old gentleman who had initially presented with exertional chest pressure several weeks prior to this admission that would resolve with rest .
Stress echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 40% , hypokinesis of distal anterior wall , akinesis of distal inferior wall and apex .
The patient had a cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel disease and the patient now presents for elective coronary artery bypass grafting .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was initially admitted to the medical service for optimization prior to his coronary artery bypass graft .
The patient was given stress dose steroids on the day prior to his surgery .
He was closely followed from his admission through to his discharge by the renal service for his transplant issues .
On 2016-02-15 , the patient was taken to the operating room and had an off pump coronary artery bypass graft performed with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and posterior descending artery .
For details of this operation , please see the previously dictated operative note .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the CSRU for close monitoring .
On the evening of postoperative day number zero , the patient had decreased urine output and was placed on a Lasix drip for diuresis .
The patient tolerated this well .
The renal service continued to follow close management of his immunosuppression .
On postoperative day number one , the patient was extubated and awakened from sedation .
He did well on this and his Levophed drip was weaned to off as tolerated .
Over the course of his Intensive Care Unit stay , the patient received six units of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit .
He otherwise had a fairly uncomplicated postoperative course .
On postoperative day number three , the patient was transferred to the floor .
On postoperative day number four , the patient was noted to have a low platelet level of 43,000 .
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia antibody panel was sent .
Other than this , the patient did very well .
Chest tubes were removed when output was low .
Pacing wires were removed .
Physical therapy saw the patient and cleared the patient for discharge .
Ultimately , the patient was discharged on postoperative day number six tolerating a regular diet , adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications , and ambulating well with clearance of physical therapy .

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Vinktlandfreierm was admitted from Owaleharbo Tanaminer Hospital to which he had been discharged approximately four days prior to admission .
He was noted to have dark stools per rectum and to be somewhat fluid overloaded .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and found to have a significant hematocrit drop from 33.8 to 24.3 .
He was found operation be short of breath and was taken to dialysis for apparent fluid overload .
His gastrointestinal bleeding issues were investigated with an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple superficial gastric ulcerations consistent with an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs gastropathy .
He had been discharged on one aspirin a day with 20 of Prilosec b.i.d.
The aspirin was discontinued and he had no further problems with gastrointestinal bleeding and a stable hematocrit the rest of his hospitalization .
During the course of his hospitalization , he became increasingly lethargic .
An extensive work-up was done for any metabolic abnormalities which was unrevealing .
He responded somewhat to lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy .
He had one positive blood culture for Vancomycin resistant enterococcus .
In the few days prior to his demise , he was intermittently somewhat lethargic buton the morning of June 25 , 1999 , his white count was noted to have increased from 8 to 13,000 .
That day , he was found to be acutely short of breath with a respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturations in the mid seventies .
He was put on 100% nonrebreather and his oxygen saturations improved to the low nineties .
Nasal trumpet suction was done and he was found to have food like material that was easily suctioned out .
He was also found to havesome pieces of toast in his mouth .
Blood gases were done and he was found to have a pH of 7.2 with a pCO2 of 21 .
Fingerstick glucose revealed a sugar of 12 .
A stat panel 7 confirmed that the sugar was 23 and that he had a new anion gap of 40 .
Repeat blood gas was done which was almost identical to the first .
The family was called and came in to see the patient .
An extensive family meeting was held and the family agreed that it did not make sense to intubate the patient and send him to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the acute setting , he had been started on levofloxacin , Flagyl , and Vancomycin .
These antibiotics were continued but the family decided that they wanted us to emphasize the comfort of the patient and pursue no further invasive measures .
The patient was made do not resuscitate / do not intubate .
At 2:30 on June 26 , 1999 , I was called to see the patient who had expired .
DISPOSITION :
The family was notified and came in to see the patient .
The family declined an autopsy saying that they felt that the patient had been through enough .
The patient &apos;s attending physician , Dr. Erm Neidwierst , was notified as well .

History of Present Illness :
52 y.o. male with ESLD due to HCV / EtOH Cirrhosis now with delta MS .
Recently d/c 'd on 05-15 after admission for hepatic encephalopathy versus opiate abuse .
Brought in by family for ams .
No hx available at Youville Hospital Katherine , except for abdominal pain .
Increasing tachypnea and tachycardia in Leola , cxr with likely aspiration pna versus chf , intubated .
Started on levo / flagyl / ceftriaxone and lasix for sbp and questionable meningitis .
Brief Hospital Course :
SBP :
Pt admitted with E coli SPB and bacteremia .
Was treated with ceftriaxone 2 gm IV daily with multiple repeat paracenteses .
Repeat taps did not revealed evidence of infection .
Patient was treated with 14 days of levoflox .
Resp failure :
Unclear etiology , but likely aspiration event in Monica .
Treated aspiration pneumonia .
Weaning and potential extubation complicated by mechanical disadvantage from large ascites as well as continued somnolence ( off sedation ).
we Performed frequent large vol taps and attempted to give diuretics , but were limited by renal failure .
The ascites quickly accumulated after each tap .
Patient was not a TIPS candidate .
Cirrhosis :
End-stage cirrhosis with refractory ascites .
Each time we have initiated diuretics , creatinine rose .
Patient was continued on nadolol ( as bp tolerated ) and lactulose )
Renal failure :
Creatinine elevation appears to be related to both elevated abdominal pressures from ascites as well as to attempts at diuresis .
AMS :
Likely hepatic encepholopathy initially , and later likely related to sedation and delayed clearance from liver disease .
Patient became increasingly hypotensive with a rising cr , eventually becoming pressor dependent .
Family meeting was held to discuss grave prognosis , and patient was made cmo .
He passed away shortly thereafter .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Carotid stenosis .
2. Aortic stenosis .
3. Coronary artery disease .
PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the medicine service on 04-29-92 with a past history significant for aortic stenosis and chest pain who presented for evaluation for aortic valve replace-ment .
The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; .
She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea .
She denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest .
The pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement .
Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history .
Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on 4-13-92 , done in Otte A , New Jersey and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 .
She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally .
She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension .
Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 .
HEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable .
Her neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur .
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds .
Extremi-ties :
There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable .
LAB / X-RAY DATA :
Labs on admission :
Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 .
EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
She was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the right coronary artery .
Carotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery &quot; critical stenosis &quot; .
On 05-01-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy .
This was performed by Dr. Medicine and Dr. Room .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .
She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness .
On 05-04-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .
There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted .
On 05-05-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later .
However , on 05-07-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination .
She was begun on a heparin drip .
On 5-9-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia .
She underwent angiography on 5-9-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy .
She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by 5-11-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness .
She was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid .
She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .
She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement .
DISPOSITION :
She is transferred to Rockdempbanri Hospital on 05-28-92 to continue her rehabilitation .
Discharge medications :
Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Timoptic solution 0.5% OS b.i.d. ; Coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and Haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion .
Upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .

The patient began having generalized tonic - clonic seizures in 1988 , which at the time were thought to be related to asthma medications .
At this time , his head CT was negative , and he was treated with Dilantin and Phenobarbital .
However , he continued to have left arm focal motor seizures and problems thinking .
In 2001-08-31 he stopped his medication and had a generalized tonic - clonic seizure in 12/94 .
He was diagnosed by biopsy with oligodendroglioma , and gross total resection by Dr. Redner in
95 revealed a low-grade oligodendroglioma .
He was followed by Dr. Gregory Dumas , with serial MRI 's.

He had a repeat total resection in 4/04 by Dr. Peter Hoadley at Hallmark Health System which revealed anaplastic oligodendroglioma grade III .
He had radiation following the resection and was doing well on monthly Temodar until 2012-04-23 when he had a marked change in behavior , his balance was off , speech slurred , and he had difficulty using the computer .
A head MRI on 2012-04-24 revealed increasing tumor infiltration with increased edema and mass effect .
He underwent a right craniotomy with resection and gliadel wafers on 2012-05-02 at Hallmark Health System by Dr. Ackley .
Came for neurosurgery follow up on 05-21 , and had been having clear fluid leaking from his incision , as well as frontal headache , imbalance , bumping into things with his left leg and worsening tremors .

he had to have it replaced , however , because his head incision began to leak again .
On 06-03 he was taken back to the OR for debridement of his head wound with removal of the remaining gliadel waffers .
He tolerated the procedure well , postop however he had a grand mal seizure and was intubated and sent to the ICU .
ID was consulted for both the abd abcess and possible meningitis given the large amount of wbc in the csf cultures .
Patient was placed on vancomycin 1 gm IV q12 and zosyn .
He was kept on antibiotics until 06-17 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 70 year old gravida IV , para 4 who presented for a vaginal hysterectomy secondary to uterine prolapse and also presented for evaluation of a suspicious lesion seen on a mammogram .
Patient &apos;s problem started four years ago when she first experienced a pushing forward of her uterus .
The patient described this sensation as uncomfortable and becoming more prominent over the following three years with increasing pressure and pain .
Two months ago , the patient slipped and fell with valsalva that precipitated an exacerbation of her prolapse .
She subsequently could not urinate and was in pain secondary to her problem .
At this time , she decided that she needed the prolapse fixed and actually wrote to the Norri Hospital to try and find a Gynecologist .
Her letter was referred to Dr. Earllamarg Para who saw her in the office and recommended vaginal hysterectomy .
Patient has never had a pessary and refused one and denies nausea , fever , chills , dysuria , or stress incontinence on her current admission .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiology was consulted to evaluate this and felt that the changes seen on the EKG were not significant .
The patient was also seen by Dr. Nusc from General Surgery for evaluation of micro calcifications in the right breast .
The patient refused a biopsy for this admission and desires follow-up mammograms .
She is to be followed up by General Surgery .
The patient underwent a total vaginal hysterectomy on June 4 , 1993 which she tolerated without complications .
Her post-operative course has been uncomplicated .
She remained afebrile throughout her admission tolerating a regular diet by post-operative day two and was discharged on June 6 , 1993 with Percocet for pain .
The Foley was discontinued and the patient was urinating on her own .

History of Present Illness :
Mr. Pizano is a 75 y/o man who has a PMHx significant for Enterococcus mitral valve endocarditis which has been treated since 09-19 .
He has had 2 6 week courses of antibiotics with recurrent bacteremia .
He had a TEE on 2019-01-22 which revealed thickened mitral leaflets with small vegetations on both anterior and posterior leaflets with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation .
He has preserved LV systolic function with mild TR and AR and LAE without abscess .
He had a repeat TEE on 02-19 which revealed 4 + MR .
Thomasine was tranferred from MWMC ( where he was admitted on 02-15 with fevers and positive blood cultures ) to IDMC for further treatment and possibly MVR .
Brief Hospital Course :
As mentioned in the HPI , Mr. Mcculley was transferred from MWMC to Nantucket Cottage Hospital for ongoing care ( ? MVR ).
And Infectious disease consult was immediately made .
IV Daptomycin was continued via PICC line which was inserted on 02-20 at MWMC .
Mr Stutts had an extensive preop evaluation including cardiology , infectious diseases , orthopedics , psychiatry and ethics services .
He ultimately was brought to the operating room on 03-19 .
At that time he had a Mitral Valve replacement , aortoomy , and left atrial appendage resection .
His bypass time was 103 minutes / crossclamp 89 mins .
Please see OR report for full details .
He tolerated the surgery well and was transferred from the OR to the CSRU on Epinephrinne and Propofol infusions .
He did well in immediate postoperative period .
Following surgery his anesthesia was reversed , he was weaned from ventilator and successfully extubated .
His iv medications were also weaned to off .
On POD1 His PA line and chest tubes were removed , he was also started on Beta blockers and diuretics .
On POD2 the patient remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred from the ICU to F2 for continued postop care .
Over the next several days with the assisstance of the nursing staff and physical therapy the patients activity level was advanced , he was transitioned to all oral medications with the exception of his antibiotics .
On POD7 it was decided that the pt was stable and ready for discharge to rehabilitation .

Per daughter , pt was in her USOH until two days prior to admission when she was noted to have a superficial ulcerations on her foot with erythema .
Pt was taken to Bridgewater Chelsea Soldier 's Home Hospital and started on unasyn IV .
Pt awoke later that night and felt unsteady on her feet and sustained a mechanical fall .
Per daughter , pt did not note chest pain , tachycardia , had a good PO intake and no noted seizure activity .
Pt was in severe " back pain " as per daughter which was treated with dilaudid .
CT of the neck revealed a possible C1 fracture and the X-ray at the OSH revealed intratrochanteric fracture of the right femur .
Pt was subsequently transferred to Hallmark Health System for orthopaedic evaluation .
In Monica at Hallmark Health System , pt was seen by the Trauma service where a CT of the neck revealed no fracture ( however , the c-collar was maintained secondary to pain ) .
The orthopaedic service recommended emergent repair of the intratrochanteric fracture secondary to instability .
The Monica stay was complicated by runs of afib to 133 requiring IV lopressor .
ROS :
Pt is very SOB at baseline , not on home ox , no CP at rest , no LE edema , no PND , stable orthopnea ( 2 pillows ) .
Pt ambulates 10 feet with significant fatigue as per daughter .

ORIF with repair of neck fracture 2016-03-23 .
Had expected prolonged post-op extubation in PACU given COPD history , as with colon CA resection surgery .
In PM extubated , transferred to floor 2016-03-23 .
Late 03-23 found with afib and RVR , given beta blocker with min. response , started dilt. drip .
Received 2 mg dilaudid for pain o/n .
On 03-24 AM p/w with respiratory failure , continued tachycardia on dilt. gtt.
Transferred to unit and urgently intubated .
Of note , there was a question of misplaced NGT .
When NGT tube was pulled out , it was noted to have respiratory-like secretions .
Concern for aspiration of mediations to lungs .
However , evaluation of CXR revealed NGT coiled in esophagus .
Pt 's respiratory distress is most likely on setting of aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis in the setting of depressed mental status secondary to post-operative narcotics .
Pt was pan-cultured and switched from unasyn ( started at OSH for foot ulcer ) to zosyn .
Vanco was added for possible nosocomial infection .
CTA was performed which was negative for PE , but revealed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities c/w aspiration vs. pneumonia vs. edema .
Pt was weaned down on ventilator , minimal secretions noted .
On 03-27 , pt was noted to have depressed mental status off all sedating medications ; mental status improved over the course of the day .
Pt was diuresed .
Atrial fibrillation was rate-controlled on dilt drip .
Dilt drip was discontinued and metoprolol titrated up .
Cardiac enzymes were cycled in setting of rapid AF and were flat .
Initially , pt was noted to be dry with low FeNa and given IVF .
Then , noted to be volume overloaded and diuresed with lasix .
Pt had depressed mental status on transfer to CMED in setting of narcotics .
She was then started on propofol while intubated .
Head CT was negative for acute bleed , mass effect , or stroke .
Mental status improved during times when propofol was held .

Admission white blood count 4.3 , hematocrit 31.0 , electrolytes were all within normal limits , glucose 218 , prothrombin time on admission was 15.1 with INR of 1.5 , partial thromboplastin time 23.3 .
The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response and digitalis effect as well as left ventricular hypertrophy .
IMPRESSION ON ADMISSION :
Impression was that this was an 83-year-old female with cardiac history , dyspnea on exertion , increased calcium and hyperparathyroidism who presents for parathyroidectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On the day of admission , the patient was brought to the operating room for parathyroidectomy .
The right superior parathyroid gland was found to be markedly enlarged and consistent with an adenoma .
Her right superior parathyroid gland was removed and the rest of her parathyroid glands were left in place .
Postoperatively , the patient did well and was able to cough and phonate completely with no changes from preoperative .
The plan was to start her on heparin and Coumadin and discontinue her heparin when her Coumadin levels became therapeutic as judged by the prothrombin time / INR .
However , on postoperative day number two , the patient in the afternoon noticed some tingling in her hands and also some tingling hear her perioral region .
She had a negative Chvostek &apos;s and negative Trousseau &apos;s sign .
She had no muscular weakness noted .
An ionized calcium was drawn which was low at 1.0 .
As a result , the patient was started on Os-Cal 250 mg PO q.i.d. On postoperative day number three , her ionized calcium was 1.06 and her Os-Cal was increased to 500 q.i.d.
However , her ionized calcium decreased to 0.97 and she was given one amp of calcium gluconate .
On postoperative day number five , the patient felt fine and had an INR of 1.9 with a prothrombin time of 16.6 .
Her calcium was 8.5 , albumin 3.6 , and phosphate 4.5 .
She had had no further episodes of tingling in her fingers after the initial episode which had prompted us originally to draw the ionized calcium .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Coumadin 5 mg PO q.day , then she will follow up with her primary care physician and decide the dosage thereafter ,
2. Lopid 600 mg PO b.i.d. ,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 70-year-old female with cryptogenic cirrhosis .
She has a history of esophageal varices and a history of an Upper GI bleed .
She has had one pervious episode of variceal bleeding with an unclear date .
However she is followed by a Dr. Joasscchird at Vaila Medical Center .
She was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she felt increasing fatigue , nausea and vomiting productive of bright red blood and coffee ground emesis .
She also had some black , tarry stool in her colostomy bag .
At Vaila Medical Center , she had a hematocrit of 25 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells .
She had an upper endoscopy at Va Sit Namar Healthcare showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .
She was started on Pitressin , a Blakemore tube was inserted .
She was transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Intensive Care Unit where on January 25 in the morning her hematocrit was found to be 27.4 .
She was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .
The GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .
Her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .
after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .
At that time she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to Coden 2 for the Lemgarson Hospital service .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the Lemgarson Hospital service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
Her PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .
The rest of her labs were unremarkable .
She was watched very closely while on the floor .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until January 26 when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
She therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to North Dakota .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. Joasscchird , tel. 090-249-6079 , at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and Dr. Acrookesjo at Do Of Hospital , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with AH and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. Acrookesjo in one week and Dr. Work the gastrointestinal fellow here at PUOMC in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Left sided spastic hemiparesis , status post surgical correction of C-1 , C-2 dural AVM .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Breunlinke is a 69 year-old right handed woman , status post surgical correction of a C-1 to C-2 dural AVM in January , 1998 , now presenting with a one month history of increasing left sided weakness and pain with spasticity , occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain .
She was originally admitted to the Verg Medical Center in January , 1998 , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity .
She was found to have intermedullary lesion at C1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected .
The postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention .
She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery .
As of the beginning of September , 1999 , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ) .
Functionally , she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support .
Over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated .
She is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up .
Her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact .
She has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she has lost ten pounds .
She denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency .
Over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently .
The patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum .
This pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history notable for coronary artery disease and CABG x2 in 2001 .
The patient has felt unwell since 7/21 after his non-Q wave MI .
The patient , at this time , was started on Statin and developed in arthritis approximately one month later with joint pain , myalgia and fatigue .
No clear diagnosis was made .
The patient was presumed to have a rheumatoid factor negative , rheumatoid arthritis and he was prescribed Naprosyn , prednisone and sulfasalazine .
He had a CABG review in 2/21 .
His first CABG was in 02/89 .
Since 2/21 , he has had increasing weight loss of 30-49 pounds , night sweats which he attributed to the prednisone and increased fatigue and myalgias .
The patient has gradually taken to bed with decreasing activity .
In late 7/22 , sulfasalazine was started at one tab three times a day .
The patient subsequently developed diffuse abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , and decreased p.o. intake .
A guaiac positive stool was also noted in the month of July .
10 days prior to admission , the patient &apos;s primary care physician increased his sulfasalazine dose to two tabs three times a day .
The patient &apos;s prednisone was increased to 60 mg q.d. as the patient was diagnosed with an arthritis flare .
The prednisone dose was gradually tapered to 20 mg q.d.
The day before admission , the patient developed a fever to 102 degrees and increasing abdominal pain .
He presented to an outside hops where he was noted to be leukopenic with a white blood cell count of 0.6 , 0 neutrophils , a hematocrit of 32 , platelets of 326 , a MCV of 79 , and RDW of 22 .
The patient was given IV fluids and treated with imipenem , transferred to Ca Valley Hospital ED , where it was noted that the patient had face and neck swelling , as well as erythema and cervical lymphadenopathy .
The patient states that his swelling of his face began two days prior to admission and has doubled since then .
In the emergency department , CT of head , neck and abdomen were performed .
The CT of the abdomen was without lymphadenopathy , revealed a right renal cyst , otherwise unremarkable .
The CT of head and neck was likewise unremarkable showing no evidence of fasciitis or deep tissue thread .
No abscesses were noted .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The patient denies shortness of breath , chest pain , orthopnea , no dysuria , hematuria , no visual changes , no rashes , no blurry vision .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was started on ceftazidime , nafcillin and Flagyl for concern of a soft tissue infection .
Neutropenic precautions were taken .
The patient had a bone marrow biopsy which showed myeloid arrest and probable neutropenia from a drug-related cause presumed to be the sulfasalazine .
Over the course of the hospitalization , the patient &apos;s white blood cell count rose from 0.4 to 6.3 after he was given G-CSF , a course lasting from 9/28/01 until 9/30/01 .
After the G-CSF , the absolute neutrophil count was greater than 8000 .
On 10/3/01 , the patient had a repeat head and neck CT , which showed a right parotitis and left submandibular lymphadenopathy with some necrosis .
No frank abscesses .
The patient &apos;s antibiotics were changed to clindamycin 300 mg q.i.d. and patient was also put on sialagogue .
Over the course of the hospitalization , the swelling and tenderness and erythema have steadily decreased .
Recommendations on antibiotics were made by infectious disease team , who was consulted .
Rheumatology was also consulted for patient and after workup , it was believed that arthritis may be a rheumatoid factor negative , rheumatoid polyarthritis .
Rheumatology recommended a taper of his prednisone to 20 mg q.d. and the patient will be followed by the rheumatology service .
The oncology service was also consulted for patient and performed a bone marrow biopsy .
Throughout his course during this hospitalization , the patient was also followed by the ENT service .
The ENT physicians did not recommend any procedures , incision and drainage for his right parotitis or left submandibular cervical lymph node necrosis .
The ENT team recommended watching patient in-house for two days after his repeat imaging on 10/3/01 , and to continue antibiotic coverage with clindamycin .
The patient had no positive blood cultures during his hospitalization and remained afebrile after the second day of admission .

CMED CCU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 26 - year-old female with a past medical history significant for nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15-20% , who presents with a one-week history of progressive shortness of breath .
She reports orthopnea with an increasing pillow requirement of 2-4 with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
Patient also reports a 6-pound weight gain over the last four days with associated lower extremity edema .
She also reports positional chest pain , which is worse with lying down and relieved with sitting up .
She denies any pain with activity .
She also reports a cough productive of green sputum for approximately one week .
She does report chills , but no fevers .
In the Emergency Department , she was started on a nesiritide drip and responded well with 2000 cc urine output .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Congestive heart failure :
Patient was diuresed effectively with nesiritide and Lasix .
Patient 's weight on admission was 250 pounds , and on the day of discharge was 244 pounds which was back to her dry weight .
She had lost the 6 pounds that she reported gaining in the four days prior to her hospitalization .
Patient was continued on her Toprol , her lisinopril , and her digoxin .
Patient 's Coumadin was held for right heart catheterization and biopsy , and then EP study with ICD placement .
Patient did have Woodrow Betty , SPEP , and anticardiolipin antibody sent for further workup of the etiology of her cardiomyopathy .
The Courtney , SPEP , and anticardiolipin antibody were all negative .
Her CKs did trend down over the course of her hospital stay , and in the setting of her known clean coronaries on cardiac catheterization in 2011-11-19 , it was believed that a myocarditis might be the cause of her elevated cardiac enzymes and also could have exacerbated her congestive heart failure .
Patient did receive a right heart catheterization , which showed elevated wedge pressures and biopsy specimens were obtained of the right ventricle .
The results of these biopsies are still pending in pathology .
Post right heart catheterization and right ventricular biopsy , the patient was sent to the CCU for a Swan - guided therapy in the setting of her elevated wedge pressures and low cardiac output .
In the CCU , she was put on milrinone with good results .
Patient was also seen by the Pulmonary service here and had pulmonary function tests done as part of a pretransplant workup .
There is no pulmonary process to exclude her from the transplant list as noted by the Pulmonary service .
Patient did receive an ICD during this hospital admission without complication .
Patient was in bigeminy during the course of her hospital stay , and did have frequent runs of ectopy as noted on telemetry .
2. Her right lower lobe infiltrate :
Patient did report a cough productive of green sputum on admission .
She received a full course of azithromycin for this with resolution of her cough and sputum production .
On discharge , the patient was restarted on her Coumadin , which was held for her right heart catheterization , and her biopsy , and her ICD placement .
She was also continued on all her heart failure medications including her Toprol , her lisinopril , her digoxin , and her Lasix .

Service :
MEDICAL ICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 57-year-old nursing home resident female , who had been in her usual state of health until about three weeks ago when the daughter noted she was sleeping more .
Per record , she has had multiple episodes in the last week of changes in mental status .
EMTs called many times .
The patient would awake prior to arrival and not need transfer .
The patient was seen at the Leonard Morse/Metrowest Medical Center on 09-28 .
No localizing etiology of delta MS .
That evening she was unresponsive and the patient was brought to Amesbury Hospital Hospital .
There her oxygen she was sating 65% on room air , increased to 98% with a nonrebreather mask .
There an ABG was done which showed an ABG of 7.42 , 62 , and 55 .
She had a head CT that was negative .
Chest x-ray that was questionable left lower lobe infiltrate .
Lumbar puncture was performed and the micro cultures are still pending .
She was seen by Psychiatry at the outside hospital , but noted there was no psychoses , but delirium .
The patient 's mental status waxed and waned there .
She also had a K of 6.0 and given 30 of Kayexalate , 5 of Haldol , 2 mg of Ativan given for
agitation , and 2 mg of ceftriaxone was given for a temperature of 101.3 with a concern for meningitis as a LP was done prior .
Patient was transferred to the Kindred Hospital Melendez the patient 's primary care provider was here .
She is currently being seen by Addison Gilbert Hospital Group .
On arrival to Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary , she was unresponsive with an oxygen saturation of 72% on 6 liters .
She was placed on 50% vent mask , which improved her oxygenation to 97% .
Patient was placed on BiPAP .
Original ABG here before BiPAP was 7.19 , 102 , and 92 .
After being placed on BiPAP , her blood pressure decreased to the 80s .
She responded to 1 liter of IV fluids , normal saline and blood pressure remained stable .
Patient had peripheral IV x1 placed and right femoral line placed in the Matthew .
When laying flat , her sats decreased to 50% on 30% FIO2 , PEEP of 10 , and pressure support of 5 .
Her ABG at the time was 7.24 , 91 , and 38 .
Once the patient sat up , her sats improved and her airway was no longer obstructed .
After a history on BiPAP about a half an hour , her ABG was 7.29 , 79 , and 106 on 30% pressure support of 5 and PEEP of 10 .
Patient was intermittently awaking .
She denied any pain and was not answering questions at the time .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure issues :
The patient presented with changes in mental status , pCO2 of 100 , pH of 7.19 , decreasing sats on arrival likely element of obstructive-sleep apnea .
She was monitored overnight .
She had admitted to the CMED and had multiple episodes of apnea throughout the night .
She was placed on pressure support , which improved her saturations and decreased her hypercarbia .
Patient improved that her mental status with improvement of her oxygenation and ventilation as well as for correction of her respiratory acidosis .
Patient was eventually placed on BiPAP on hospital day three , on the date prior to discharge of BiPAP settings of 12/8/5 liters of oxygen with saturations of 96% with a gas of 7.38 , 67 , and 91 with an aim of a goal pCO2 of 67 .
She only had one episode of apnea on the day prior to discharge .
2. Delta MS/mental status issues :
Most likely her waxing and waning mental status and hypercarbia/hypoxia compounded by infection of pneumonia and UTI .
With improvements of her ventilation and oxygenation and treatment with levofloxacin of her UTI and pneumonia , her mental status greatly improved on hospital day two without further waxing and waning .
Her daughters came by and visited her , and reported that she was at her baseline mental status on the day prior to discharge .
B12 , folate , RPR were all sent that were unremarkable as causes for delta MS .
We are awaiting results of the lumbar puncture from the outside hospital , but on hospital day two .
Those cultures are still pending at the time .
Patient was also given multivites .
3. Fever issues :
The patient initially presented with T max of 101.3 at outside hospital with increasing white blood cell counts and a positive urinalysis .
A chest x-ray with bilateral patchy infiltrates likely pneumonia and UTI .
Upon calling the outside hospital , the urine was growing out Klebsiella , and patient was given a 10 day course of levofloxacin to cover both the pneumonia and UTI .
Blood cultures and urine cultures are still pending at this hospital visit and the CSF fluid from Whitter Rehabilitation Hospital needs to be further evaluated .
Patient on the day of discharge was afebrile with a decreasing white count x48 hours .
4. Acute renal failure issues :
Creatinine initially presented at 1.3 .
Patient is known to have a baseline of 1.0 , most likely hypovolemia and prerenal .
A FENa was sent , was 0.3% .
Patient was gently hydrated and IV fluids started up on a p.o. diet regimen .
On hospital day two , her creatinine returned to 0.8 , and she remained with a creatinine of 0.8 for the remainder of her hospital stay .
Patient's K was followed , and trended back down to normal on the day of discharge at 3.9 .
5. Elevated transaminases :
Patient had no right upper quadrant pain .
Stewart sign was negative .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed that showed no hepatic or biliary pathology likely due to acute phase stress changes given the fact that she had no clinical symptoms .
There is no need to followup these transaminases .
6. Congestive heart failure history :
Patient was stable without evidence of CHF on chest x-ray .
Followed her sats likely due to obstructive-sleep apnea and hypoventilation .
Patient was restarted on her beta blocker and .......- receptor blocker on hospital day two given that her creatinine had stabilized .
Patient had no further cardiac issues at this time .
She was on telemetry without any episodes of any rhythm abnormalities .
7. CMED CCU :
The patient had some vaginal bleeding x2 days .
Patient had a history of fibroids during this hospitalization .
Followed her examination .
Her hematocrit remained stable throughout this course .
Patient is strongly encouraged to followup with her outside primary care provider to followup for the vaginal bleeding given her history of fibroids and question metaplasia of the endometrium .
8. Heme :
Her hematocrit remained stable .
She had a history of nucleated RBCs likely secondary to stress and hypoxia during this admission .
Hemolysis laboratories were negative .
Patient was restarted on her iron supplementation .
Reticulocyte count was performed that was negative .
9. FEN :
She was NPO with a decrease in her mental status .
We slowly advanced her diet as her mental status improved and repleted her electrolytes , and started on her p.o. medications on hospital day two .
10. Diabetes :
Patient had q.i.d. fingersticks with a Humalog sliding scale and NPH doses were cut in half while she was NPO , and they were brought back to her normal doses on the day of discharge with a full diet .
11. Code status :
Full .
Two daughters came by and requested to be health care proxies as patient approved .
Documentation is in her medical chart .
12. Prophylaxis :
The patient was on subQ Heparin for DVT and ranitidine for GI prophylaxis .
DISPOSITION:
The patient is to be discharged today to Lahey Clinic - North Shore Hospital for long-term pulmonary ........ therapy and further evaluation of her obstructive-sleep apnea .

NEUROLOGIC MEDICINE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is an 86 year old woman who has a history of atrial fibrillation , peripheral vascular disease , and a history of atrial emboli who was admitted on 2013-09-06 , to the Neurologic Intensive Care Unit service after collapsing at home at 8:30 p.m .
She was found to have right sided weakness and was noted by her husband to have vomited .
She was found comatose at home by EMS and was brought to the Emergency Department .
On arrival to the Emergency Department , she was noted to have a temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure 164/110 , respiratory rate 28 , and heart rate of 74 .
She was found to be responsive only to painful stimuli at this time .
She was intubated for airway protection and received multiple medications prior to her initial neurologic examination .
She was also noted to have a cold distal left upper extremity which was operated on and she is now status post left brachial artery embolectomy .
Throughout her course on the Intensive Care Unit service , she has remained unresponsive with imaging studies consistent with a large left middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery distribution cerebral infarction with mass effect and midline shift .
There is evidence of bilateral occipital and cerebellar infarctions as well .
Discussion with the patient 's family by the Intensive Care Unit service has resulted in focusing on her comfort care .
This decision was made after an extensive discussion with her husband and family as the likelihood of significant meaningful recovery is extremely low .
Based on this , she is transferred to the Neurology service for focus on comfort care .

History of Present Illness :
HPI : This is a 79 y/o M with h/o of HTN , DM , recent CVA Theresa , chronic respiratory failure on vent , trached , ESRD on HD who was sent from rehab facility for worsening mental status .
Per refferal notes , he went to hemodyalisis today in the morning .
1 L was removed .
At about 2:30 pm , he was found to have worsening mental status .
In that setting he was hypotensive down to the 92/45 , and was given 1 L NS .
Fs was also checked 179 .
At that time , it seems that he had been on T peace since 4 am today .
At 2:30 he was also found with sats in the 90% .
ABG done 7.1 , 89/72 - he was placed on AC 600 / 0.4 and 6 PEEP - sats up to 94% .
Given persistent lethargy , patient was sent to Falkener Amanda .
Of note , after interview with HCP , at around 07-23 , patient started having episodes of dizziness , and had unstable gait .
he was taken to Williams ICU until 08-09 when he was discharged to Waltham/Weston Hospital Rehab .
he had a peg tube and tracheostomy prior to d/c .
He had been chronicallyl vent dependent .
His companion states that they have been trying to wean him down at rehab .
his basline mental staus apparently responds with his head shaking , and also try to write sentences .
In the Amanda : VS T 103 rectal BP90/44 HR : 84 RR 16 Sats : 98 + guiac stool .
He received tylenol , levofloxacin 500 mg IV , Flagyl 500 mg and Vancomycin and I L NS .

Brief Hospital Course :
Assessment and Plan :
This is a 79 y/o M with h/o HTN , DM , recent CVA , chronic ventilatory failure , CRI on HD who presents with change in MS and febrile in the Amanda , admitted to CMED .
# Altered mental status : Ct scan with no evidence of new intracraneal bleeding .
Patient febrile in the Amanda .
High WBC .
It was thought that it could have been a combination of hypotension , hypercapnia and infection .
He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics .
Despite having a profund limitation communicating given his neurological status , his mental changes seemed to improved initially .
However later on during his course , his mental status deteriorated , being even less responsive .
# ID :
Patient febrile and with a high WBC on admission .
After starting broad spectrum antibiotics - cefepime - vancomycin and flagyl ( for initial concern of aspiration pneumonia ), he responded clinically .
Urine cx from Rehab showed gram negative rods > 100 K enterobacter cloacae .
Urine Cx in house grew Citrobacter Freundi and his sputum grew Acinetobacter Baummani .
Since there was no more evidence of gram positive infections , vancomycin was discontinued and cefepime was kept .
# Fevers : in the Amanda , high WBC , possible pneumonia .
Also possible source sinus infections given findings on intial CT ( see summary in significant studies ). He did not spike any fevers after being transfer to the CMED from the Amanda .
# Resp : Patient was intermitentely switched from AC to Pressure support trials .
However , after Patient did well .
Then trach mask trials were done .
He tolerated this well , although he required PS overnight .
# ESRD on hemodyalisis : Renal service was consulted and HD was continued .
# CV :
Rhythm : NSR , not tachycardic .
Pump : With trace of lower extremity edema .
X ray suggested some pulmonary edema on admission .
Despite this findings , he was supported with 40% FIO2 most of the time .
CAD : On admission Ck low normal , MB not done .
Troponin 0.44. 
It was more likely due to CRI .
Second set 12 hours apart , showed no changes .
s/p stroke : continue aspirin , statin , plavix
# Hypotension : per referral form .
Intially concern for sepsis in the setting of fevers and high blood count .
His BP medications were held on admission .
Patient did not require pressors .
His blood pressure remained stable and BP meds were restarted .
# FEN :
Tube feedings were started thorugh peg tube .
On 2013-09-08 , patient pulled out peg tube .
Temporary foley was placed and on 2013-09-11 ,
On 2013-09-12 after deterioration of his mental status and also of his blood pressure , goals of care were discussed with his HCP .
It was decided to direct goals of care towards confort care .
Patient passed away accompanied by his significant other .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus , steroid-treated polymyalgia rheumatica , hypertension , benign prostatic hypertrophy , and high cholesterol who presented for a lower extremity peripheral angiography for bilateral foot ulcers , and he was found to an evaluated blood urea nitrogen , and creatinine , and potassium .
The patient notes he developed worsening foot pain and ulcers four months ago .
Due to his worsening blood glucose , he was started on insulin .
His foot ulcers continued to develop , and the patient complained of pain in his feet ; primarily at night .
The patient was referred to for Vascular consultation because of the ulcerations and pain and scheduled for a lower extremity angiography on the day of admission , but due to his renal failure the procedure was cancelled .
The patient showed peaked T waves on electrocardiogram , and he was transferred to Medicine .
The patient denied any oliguria , hematuria , dysuria , foamy urine , flank pain , abdominal pain , or urinary hesitancy .
He has complained of fatigue , anorexia , and a 10-pound weight loss in the last four months .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is an 83 - year-old male with a history of diabetes , steroid-treated polymyalgia rheumatica , hypertension , benign prostatic hypertrophy , and high cholesterol without presented to the hospital for lower extremity angiograph ; however , that was deferred due to new onset renal failure .
1. RENAL FAILURE :
The patient was initially thought to be prerenal , and his renal status improved after hydration and increased oral intake .
He did have a magnetic resonance angiography of his kidneys which showed mild right-sided renal artery stenosis .
His renal function fluctuated throughout his hospital stay , and when he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit he did have decreased urine output in the setting of cardiogenic shock .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient with severe peripheral vascular disease .
During his hospital stay , he developed some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia .
He also became hypotensive on 07-02 in the setting of infection .
The patient had a central line placed and went into sustained ventricular tachycardia that was treated with lidocaine .
After being treated with lidocaine , the patient became apneic requiring intubation and transfer to the Coronary Care Unit .
His nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was treated with a lidocaine drip .
It was found that he had elevated troponins and likely an ischemic event on the 07-02 .
A repeat echocardiogram showed a decreased ejection fraction from prior .
He had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease .
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted , and due to the patient 's acute illness , they wanted to re-evaluate after the patient was extubated .
The patient continued to have intermittent episodes of ventricular tachycardia .
He was continued on lidocaine and eventually changed over to amiodarone .
He was noted to be cardiogenic shock requiring pressors .
Of note , he likely suffered a second ischemic event during his Coronary Care Unit stay .
The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter in place and had a low cardiac output .
The patient 's family eventually decided to withdraw care , and the patient was extubated and passed away on 2009-07-12 .
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin for a left lower lobe infiltrate and a urinary tract infection .
He then developed positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to levofloxacin , and that was continued .
When the patient became hypotensive and required intubation and pressors , his antibiotics were broadened , and he was put on stress-dose steroids .
He was found to have bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia .
3. PULMONARY :
The patient required intubation in the setting of hypotension and ventricular tachycardia .
He was actually extubated on 07-09 , but then reintubated one hour later due to hypoxia .
He was also found to have a bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
In brief , the patient is a 64 - year-old male with a significant history for coronary artery disease , status post three myocardial infarctions and also status post five vessel coronary artery bypass graft in ' 89 and status post multiple percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties who recently had a catheterization done in Mississippi and stent placed in 2013-03-24 .
The patient did well until approximately three to four weeks prior to presentation when he began to experience increased dyspnea on exertion .
One week prior to presentation , he had chest pain leading to a repeat catheterization at Springfield on 07-30 which showed narrowing of the stent and an ejection fraction of approximately 20% .
No intervention was done at that point .
On the evening prior to admission , the patient was awoken with chest pressure radiating to the neck anginal
equivalent which was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin .
This episode happened three times that night and finally on the fourth re-awakening , the patient presented to the Emergency Department at Springfield and was transferred to the Faulkner Hospital for coronary revascularization .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was medically managed initially and then underwent on 2013-08-09 , coronary artery bypass grafting x2 and a mitral valve annuloplasty with placement of intra-aortic balloon pump .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in relatively stable condition .
On postoperative day #1 , his balloon pump was weaned and the patient was transferred at 2 units of packed red blood cells .
He also began to wean off the ventilator .
On postoperative day #1 in the evening , the patient was noted to go into atrial fibrillation , for which he was controlled and started on amiodarone , after which he converted again to normal sinus rhythm .
He was extubated during postoperative day #1 .
On postoperative day #2 , the patient was noted to be relatively stable .
His balloon pump had already been removed and on postoperative day #3 , he was transferred to the floor on Lopressor and amiodarone in normal sinus rhythm .
On the floor , the patient was noted to do extremely well .
Physical therapy was consulted and the patient was ambulating extremely well with minimal assistance .
On postoperative day #4 , he remained afebrile with stable vital signs on Lopressor at 25 mg po bid and an amiodarone dose .
His left chest tube was discontinued at this time and his right chest tube was removed the following day on
postoperative day #5 .
Currently , the patient is postoperative day #6 .
He remains afebrile with stable vital signs and the patient is ambulating to a level 5 with physical therapy and wishes to be discharged home today .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 73 year old male with a recent history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypercholesterolemia who presented to the Emergency Department with the chief complaint of syncope .
The patient was discharged from The Hospital for Orthopedics with the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism about six months prior to the current admission and was started on Warfarin .
One month prior to this admission , the patient reports not feeling well with worsening gastric distress .
A few weeks prior to admission , he fell down on his back and started taking ibuprofen 1000 mg once a day for pain and Vioxx in addition to his aspirin and Coumadin regimen .
The night prior to admission , he was found by his wife on the bathroom floor in a pool of urine , unresponsive without any body movements , post-ictal state .
EMS was activated , however , the patient refused to go to the hospital .
A similar episode happened at 2 a.m. the same night and at 07:45 on the day of admission , the patient lost consciousness once again when he was trying to sit up .
He was then transferred to The Hospital for Orthopedics .
The patient reports some nausea and epigastric pressure which is post-prandial .
He denies any emesis , melena , diarrhea or constipation .
He describes the room spinning with attempts to sit upright .
No history of previous episodes was noted .
Denies incontinence .
He does have diaphoresis and weakness with orthostatic changes .
In the Emergency Department , stool guaiac was trace positive .
Hematocrit was 24.8 , with a baseline of 46 .
Gastric lavage was grossly positive for coffee ground material .
His INR was found to be 4.4 .
He was given Vitamin K 10 mg subcutaneously , 2.5 liters of normal saline , two units of packed red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management for acute GI bleed .
1. Gastrointestinal bleed :
The patient continued to receive blood transfusions on the floor and serial hematocrits with serial INR checks were drawn .
As he was receiving his third unit of packed red blood cells , the patient became tachycardic and short of breath .
His temperature raised from 98.6 F. , to 101.0 F.
He was shown to have rigors .
The transfusion was stopped and the patient was given Tylenol 1 mg with epinephrine , 100 mg of hydrocortisone , 25 mg of Benadryl and Demerol 15 as well as Pepcid .
He had emesis times three of 75 cc of coffee ground material .
The patient also desaturated to the low 80 s and was started on a non-rebreather mask .
His saturations improved quickly on 100% non-rebreather mask within 15 to 20 minutes .
Shortly after his mental status changed ; he became disoriented and euphoric and continued to be in this state for two more hours .
After that period of time , his mental status gradually improved and he continued to receive his blood transfusions requiring a total of ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma to reach a hematocrit of 30.0 , which remained stable for the duration of his stay .
On admission , the patient was started on high dose proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis .
On Wednesday , 11-25 , an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was significant for the following findings :
Medium hiatal hernia , Barrett's esophagus , erosion of the gastroesophageal junction , granularity , erythema and congestion of the antrum in the pre-pyloric region compatible with gastritis .
Erosions in the antrum and pre-pyloric region , granularity , erythema and congestion of the anterior bulb and posterior bulb compatible with duodenitis .
It was recommended by Gastroenterology that the patient is to stay off aspirin for at least four to six weeks at discharge to prevent further bleeding .
2. Cardiovascular :
During transfusion reaction episode , the patient had an episode of tachycardia ranging from 134 to 158 , for one to two hours .
EKG during this episode was taken and showed sinus tachycardia ; however , serial enzymes were significant for CK peaking at 1075 , MB peaking at 114 and MB index peaking at 10.8 , consistent with myocardial damage .
The day following this episode , EKG showed loss of R wave progression in anterior leads and Q waves in leads III and AVF consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarction .
The patient 's blood pressures remained stable during his stay .
He had no episodes of arrhythmia on Telemetry .
Cardiology consultation was obtained .
The myocardial infarction was attributed to demand ischemia secondary to acute hematocrit drop exacerbated by tachycardia secondary to blood transfusion reaction .
Further Cardiologic work-up was suggested as an outpatient at four to six weeks post discharge .
The patient was started on Lopressor , Lipitor and Lisinopril .
3. After ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma transfusions , the patient 's hematocrit remained stable at above 30 .
His INR decreased to 1.3 at the time of discharge .
He required no blood transfusions for four days prior to discharge .
4. History of pulmonary embolism likely secondary to frequent flying .
The need for further anti-coagulation was discussed with the patient 's attending , Dr. Coleman , and it was decided not to continue anti-coagulation due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient remained symptom free during his stay in the hospital , saturating well in room air .
5. Endocrine :
The patient was restarted on Levothyroxine soon after admission .
His hemoglobin A1C was sent and it was pending at the time of discharge .
6. Single mental status change times two hours during episode of blood transfusion reaction .
Was most likely due to multiple drugs administered during the episode including Demerol .
After this episode , the patient 's mental status remained clear for the rest of the duration of his stay .
7. Prophylaxis :
The patient was sent home on proton pump inhibitors .
His Helicobacter pylori serology was sent and was pending at the time of discharge .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Larsen was a 50-year-old salesman who in 12/26 was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .
He was found to have CML .
He was admitted on 06/07/00 for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient received his bone marrow transplant on 06/12/00 .
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On 06/24/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On 06/26/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Although the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on 07/01/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .
The patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on 07/02/00 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Dua is a 34 year old white female with an unclear history of hypertension for at least five years .
She was in her usual state of health until around 12:40 on October 19 , when while on the phone , started to have difficulty in talking .
Her speech became slurred , this was followed a few seconds after by weakness and numbness of her arm and leg .
She did not complain of headache , diplopia , or any other neurological symptoms .
She was seen at A Memorial Hospital where her blood pressure was measured at 240/120 and was found to have a mild left hemiparesis .
She was then transferred to Ro Woodma Healthcare for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the localization of the hematoma and the history of hypertension , the most likely cause for Mrs. Dua &apos;s cerebellar hemorrhage is hypertension .
A magnetic resonance imaging study will be scheduled as an outpatient in three months to rule out a small vascular malformation if responsible for the hemorrhage .
At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .
She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
She will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .
Her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .
It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient &apos;s young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .
So far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
Mr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .
He was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
He was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .
On 02/06/91 , he was seen in FLFDMC and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .
He was evaluated in the Emergency Room .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .
Cultures were taken and he was sent out .
On 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
He was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .
2) Recent PCP .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .
SKIN :
Jaundiced .
HEENT :
Revealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .
NECK :
He had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .
LUNGS :
Had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .
CARDIAC :
Showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .
His liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .
His spleen was not palpable .
RECTAL :
He had guaiac positive stools .
EXTREMITIES :
Unremarkable .
GENITOURINARY :
His penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .
PT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .
Sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .
ALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .
( On 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .
His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .
His chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .
However , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .
On 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
No other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.
DISPOSITION :
The patient died in hospital .
An autopsy will be performed .
An autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .

Service :
CMED CSRU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 35-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART with last CD4 count of 268 and undetectable viral load who was referred to the emergency room via his PCP for progressive throat pain and edema .
His throat pain began 2 to 3 days prior to admission , initially treated with ibuprofen , seen in an outside hospital emergency room day prior to admission where he received IV penicillin and was sent home .
In clinic today , the patient desaturated to low 90 s with ambulation and also had complaints of progressive swelling " like my throat is going to close up " with increasing drooling , unable to swallow the HIV medications .
Also noted to have low-grade temperature of 99 to 100 degrees with productive cough and yellow sputum times 1 day with
right ear pain .
No subjective shortness of breath .
The patient describes whole body numbness .
He currently notes improvement in his throat pain after some Decadron and clindamycin .
He was seen by CMED CSRU in the emergency room and the exam was consistent with supraglottitis .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Review of systems was negative for history of opportunistic infections or prior hospitalizations .
Of note , his CD4 count was less than 200 last winter .
He believes he is up-to-date on all his vaccines .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is a 35-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART , last CD4 count 268 with undetectable viral load who was initially admitted to the CMED CSRU for supraglottitis with significant edema .
PROBLEM LIST :
1. Epiglottitis / supraglottitis .
The patient was observed in the CMED CSRU for 48 hours and noted to have decrease in swelling on serial exams .
He was followed by the CMED CSRU Service and was started on IV Decadron initially in addition to IV Unasyn , which he tolerated well .
His edema was improving and was starting to tolerate p.o.
His airway and symptoms continued to improve and remained stable .
The patient was stable for transfer to the floor , was treated with over 72 hours of IV Unasyn , and then transitioned to oral regimen of Augmentin to be continued as an outpatient .
Eventually , his IV steroids were transitioned to a p.o. steroid taper , which he tolerated well , and was discharged on a steroid taper also with CMED CSRU follow-up as an outpatient .
His oxygenation and symptoms remained stable and again tolerated p.o. without difficulty .
Eventually , as the patient remained hemodynamically stable , his airway remained stable , and he was tolerating PO s, he was transitioned to the floor where he remained otherwise stable and asymptomatic .
His voice improved during the course of his stay and was talking clearly by the time of discharge .
He remained afebrile during the course of his stay after transfer to the floor and per CMED CSRU was to be discharged on a 2-week course of Augmentin with follow-up with Dr. Thibodeau in 2 weeks ' time in addition to a Medrol Dosepak .
1. HIV .
Once , the patient was tolerating p.o. , the patient was restarted on his HAART regimen and remained stable from that perspective .
ADMISSION DATE :
11/3/92
DISCHARGE DATE :
12/6/92
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 68 year old , right handed caucasian female , former R.N. who complained of several days of vertigo , one day of double vision , dysarthria and worsening of vertigo .
She was seen at the outside hospital and put on aspirin for two days .
An magnetic resonance imaging study showed basilar artery disease , questionable aneurysm .
The patient was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
An angiogram on 11/3 was consistent with thrombosis at the mid basilar artery .
The patient was put on heparin and was stable since .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram .
She was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .
A small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .
She was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .
This was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .
For a short time , she seemed &quot; locked in &quot; .
She has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .
Trace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .
4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .
She is unable to lift either foot off the bed .
The extra ocular movements are full .
Tongue protrudes 4 cm .
She is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .
She has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .
She has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .
She is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .
She is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .
Follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .
The patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .
A chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .
Initially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .
Sputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .
A left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .
The patient is on Ciprofloxacin .
The day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .
She has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .
She also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .
Once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .
She has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .
The patient &apos;s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .
These have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .
The exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .
The patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .
Iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .
The plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .
The patient &apos;s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .
This is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .
This must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .
The patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .
This may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .
Her sodiums were never below 130 .
She does well with tube feeds .
Her tube feeds orders are as follow :
full strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .
In addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .
She also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .
She also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .
Please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .
It is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .
She has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .
She did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .
In the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .
This did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .
As of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .
Her cholesterol was 350 here .
She has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .
These can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .
Note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 56 - year-old man without any significant past medical history who presented to the emergency room after the sudden onset of headache while he was riding a bicycle .
He characterized this headache as the worst headache of his life and had associated nausea and vomiting times one .
He also complained of dizziness at the time of headache onset .
He presented to the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial VA Hospital emergency room , where an initial head CT scan was read as negative .
However , a lumbar puncture was done , in which tube 1 showed 4800 red blood cells and tube 4 showed 4000 red blood cells .
The patient was sent for an MRI of the head , which raised the question of a right posterior cerebral artery aneurysm .
The CT scan was revealed and , on second analysis , it was thought that it was suspicious for a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern .
The patient was then admitted for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit , where a continued cerebral angiogram was done that was essentially normal , without evidence of any obvious aneurysm .
The patient was observed for two days with a repeat CT scan showing no changes from the previous examination .
The headache stabilized after the patient was transferred to the floor .
The patient continued to do well and the decision was made to discharge him .

CARDIOTHORACIC
History of Present Illness :
This is a 60 year old male with new onset chest pain .
Nuclear myocardial perfusion study was notable for a moderate fixed defect within the inferior wall and cardiac apex .
His ejection fraction however appeared preserved at 73% with mild inferior wall hypokinesis .
Subsequent cardiac catheterization at Nantucket Cottage Hospital Hospital on 2014-04-16 was significant for severe two vessel coronary artery disease .
Angiography revealed a right dominant system with a 40% lesion in the distal left main, several tight lesions in the proximal and mid left anterior descending artery , and a 90% stenosis in the proximal circumflex .
The right coronary artery had mild diffuse plaquing but no evidence of focal stenosis .
Based upon the above results , he was transferred to the Mediplex Rehab Hospital for surgical revascularization .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Chester was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and underwent routine preoperative evaluation .
He remained pain free on medical therapy .
Workup was unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery .
On 04-18 , Dr. Oneill performed off pump coronary artery bypass grafting .
For surgical details , please see seperate dictated operative note .
Following the operation , he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring .
Within 24 hours , he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident .
Given hypotension and bradycardia , he was slow to wean from Neosynephrine .
Low dose beta blockade was eventually resumed .
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed without complication .
On postoperative day three , he transferred to the SDU .
He maintained a normal sinus rhythm without atrial or ventricular arrhythmias .
He remained in sinus bradycardia ( rate 50-60 ) and tolerated low dose beta blockade .
On POD #6 his creatinine became slightly elevated at 1.4 , his lasix was discontinued and the following day his creatinine was stable at 1.4 .
He continued to progress and was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 7 .
His discharge chest x-ray showed persistent bibasilar atelectasis with only tiny pleural effusions .
Of note , he will need to remain on Plavix for three months postop given the off pump procedure .
In addition , he will need to remain on Imdur given use of his right internal mammary artery as a " free " arterial graft in preventing 
vasospasm .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 78-year-old female who has had osteoarthritis and noted the sudden onset of left knee pain in 09/89 .
Since that time , she has used a cane and she was referred to Dr. Koors .
MRI demonstrated a left femoral condyle osteonecrotic defect and degenerative meniscus .
She climbs stairs one at a time and denied rest pain .
She can one walk without difficulties .
She presented for an elective left total knee arthroplasty .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was cleared for surgery by Dr. Lupevickette Ca .
Her EKG was normal .
She was therefore taken to the Operating Room on 6/26 and underwent a left total knee arthroplasty losing 200 cc of blood in the procedure with two drains left in which were removed on the first postoperative day .
She was slightly agitated on the first postoperative day but this resolved by the second postoperative day .
Her epidural catheter was removed on 6/29 .
The Foley catheter was removed on 6/29 and she had no difficulties voiding .
Psychiatry Service saw her on 6/28 and recommended avoiding benzodiazepines and Haldol for agitation .
She was prophylaxed with Kefzol perioperatively and with Coumadin postoperatively .
She was also given whiskey spirits because of the fact that she drank one to two drinks of scotch per day .
Her hematocrit was 31.4 on 6/29 with a PT of 18.2
Her PT drifted down to a level of 12.9 by 7/3 and therefore she will be discharged with 4 mg of Coumadin per day to be followed by the Coumadin Clinic at Cowerin Tonli Medical Center .
She was discharged with a prescription for Tylenol #3 with Physical Therapy .
She did quite well with Physical Therapy and was ambulating with a walker and crutches by 7/3/90 .
She was able to flex her knees to 90 degrees by that time .
She developed no problems with edema or with her wound during her hospital stay .
She will follow-up with Dr. Koors in approximately five weeks .

LABORATORY DATA :
White blood count 4.36 , hematocrit 26.1 with platelets of 107,000 , MCV 81 .
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , chloride97 , bicarb 24 , BUN 124 , creatinine 4.1 , glucose 144 , AST 49 , ALT33 , alkaline phosphatase 253 , total bili 1.6 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 2.3 , albumin 3.4 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Gastrointestinal .
The patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .
The drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by IR , when it was accidentally removed .
Increased flow again .
The patient had signs and symptoms develop of SBP , also with an elevated white count .
He was treated broadly with amp , levo and Flagyl .
Cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .
The patient &apos;s abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .
Clinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .
He underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .
This had to be performed by IR because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .
He received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on Levofloxacin IV for prophylaxis against SBP .
2. Pulmonary .
From a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .
His apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .
Chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .
However , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .
On the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .
Chest xray is still consistent with volume overload .
The plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .
3. Cardiovascular .
He had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Echocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .
He did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .
4. Endocrine .
Diabetes .
His Avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile .
He is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin .
5. Heme .
From a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated PT INR .
He required a few transfusions during his hospital course .
He also required FFP initially to reverse his coagulopathy .
However , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .
His INR normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on Lovenox .
6. Renal .
He had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .
From his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .
However , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .
At the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .
His appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .
7. ID .
Please see GI .
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical SBP .
He will be maintained on Levofloxacin for prophylaxis against SBP .
Given that he will need continued taps,
8. Oncology .
The patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .
However , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .
His pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .
As he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .
Discussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .
Code status - the patient is a DNR / DNI .
This is an unfortunate case but Mr. Po does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus , three-vessel coronary artery bypassgraft , congestive heart failure , who presents with a humeral fracture .
The patient is admitted for preoperative and orthopedic evaluations .
The patient presented with a comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus when he slipped over the stairs , about to board an airplane back to Jeglas Blvd. , Jolouisrowarlihis , Alabama 86071 .
The fracture was seen by Orthopedics and was reduced .
During conscious sedation , the patient developed bigeminy ( the patient was sedated , did not feel chest pain or shortness of breath ) .
The patient presented to Bri Health in order to be evaluated for preoperative clearance .
He was reported to have had a myocardial infarction in the past ( EKG positive for ischemia , exercise tolerance test positive , cardiac catheterization positive , the patient is now status posta three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1987 ) .
The patient also hada history of arrhythmia , found approximately ten years ago , unknown what type .
The patient was on coumadin recently , ? whether for the arrhythmia .
Coumadin was reportedly discontinued approximately six months ago secondary to planned surgery for diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma .
The patient did not have chest pain until approximately 1-1/2 years ago , when he began to have chest tightness ( pressure ) approximately every three months with stress .
The patient has no chest pain when walking slowly and can walk approximately 1.5 miles .
He can climb approximately three flights of stairs before becoming short of breath .
He does become slightly short of breath when lifting furniture .
On the day of admission , when he fell , the patient was experiencing no chest pain , no shortness of breath , and had no loss of consciousness , no head trauma with fall .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
No fevers or chills , no chest pain , no shortness of breath .
The patient has stable three-pillow orthopnea and occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
He has a chronic cough with clear sputum .
No hemoptysis , hematemesis , abdominal pain , black or tarry stools , dysuria / frequency/urgency .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
The patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
No chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on Columbus Day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
After his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin .
4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :
GI was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
A gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .
This report needs to be followed up , and will be available at Bri Health in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. Fordwoodall Stick , in Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156 .
The patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at Bri Health , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
The patient &apos;s admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient received chest physical therapy bid .
6. ENDOCRINE :
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , pH 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
He was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 and also had Nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .
The patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .
The patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 .
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 .
FEN :
Repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .
The patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .
Admission Date :
01/16/1996
Discharge Date :
01/20/1996
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history four years ago of being admitted to the Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital after suffering an acute anterior myocardial infarction .
The course had multiple complications requiring pressors .
He had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed a three vessel coronary artery disease with an occluded RCA , 70%-80% proximal LAD , and a high grade left circumflex lesion after the OM with distal left circumflex occlusion .
The patient was subsequently medically management after this hospitalization and has done very well .
His most recent echocardiogram in April of 1995 showed an ejection fraction of 20% with a thin fibrotic septum with akinesis and moderately severe hypokinesis in all other regions except for the lateral wall .
The patient also had an electrocardiogram in April of 1995 which was negative following , however was at a low workload .
The patient &apos;s was most recently admitted to Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center on Martin Luther King Day after becoming acutely short of breath after a five minute walk .
He had no chest pain , palpitations , diaphoresis , or nausea .
He called the EMT &apos;s and was found to be in pulmonary edema by chest x-ray at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .
He was diuresed and ruled out for myocardial infarction .
His ECG showed no ischemic changes .
He was then transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for further management of his pulmonary edema .
It was felt that the patient possibly had a worsening of his coronary artery disease and therefore underwent cardiac catheterization on 01/17/96 .
At cardiac catheterization he had an RA pressure of 8 , an RV pressure of 52/10 , PA pressure of 60/25 , and wedge of 26 .
His coronary arteries revealed an 80% stenosis and a large OM .
The dominant left circumflex was occluded with left-to-left filling .
He also had a 50% LAD stenosis , a 100% large DT stenosis and a nondominant RCA with left RCA collaterals .
It was felt that this cardiac catheterization was not significantly changed from his previous catheterization .
Given his high right-sided filling pressure , he was started on Lasix for diuresis and his Captopril was increased for greater afterload reduction .
It was felt that the patient should have an augmented medical regimen and as an outpatient undergo an exercise tolerance test with viability evaluation to determine whether he would benefit from revascularization .
He was restarted on Coumadin for his low ejection fraction and started on diuresis with IV Lasix for two days and then switched to an oral Lasix regimen .

58 yo female s/p high speed MVC .
She lost contaol of her car , she hit the Barnes rails then the car stopped .
Another car was coming behind her did not see her car , hit again , the person checked the car , she was not inside .
+LOC , GCS:14 .
She ejected .
She brought by EMS to Nantucket Cottage Hospital for furher evaluation .
Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was admitted to Nantucket Cottage Hospital on 2013-03-27 following a motor vehicle crash as described previously .
Chest and pelvis X-rays were negative for fractures .
A CT of her head demonstrated intraparenchymal and extraaxial blood ( mostly subarachnoid ) in bilateral cerebral hemispheres , right greater than left , in a pattern indicating contrecoup injury .
A CT of her C-spine revealed a possible fracture of right C7 pedicle .
A CT of her chest revealed bliateral lung nodules and a right thyroid nodule .
A CT of her sinues revealed no fractures .
X-rays of her right lower extremity were negative for any acute injury .
A neurosurgery consult was obtained .
Our recommendations were to load her with Dilantin and then continue at 100 mg PO TID .
The orthopedics spine service saw her and put her in a C-collar .
She was admitted to the trauma ICU .
A repeat head CT 12 hours after the first was largely unchanged .
She was transferred to step down .
She was having some pain issues and morphine was making her " jittery ."
On HD 2 she was switched to Fioricet , which helped with her headaches .
A repeact head CT was unchanged .
An MRI of her C-spine was done to evaluate for ligamentous injury , but this was extremely limited examination due to patient motion and the signal in the spinal cord could not be adequately assessed for edema .
As per CMED CSRU spine , the patient was instructed to follow-up in 2 weeks for repeat X-rays .
On discharge she was awake , alert and orientated X3 with c/o mild headache .
She had full strength motor exam , no pronator drift and PERRLA with full EOM s.
She was ambulating without difficulties .
On 04-01 she was seen by physical therapy was thought to benefit from acute rehabilitation .
She had a head CT prior to discharge that showed resolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage .
Follow-up in 1 month with neurosurgery for a repeat head CT was arranged .
She was discharged on fioricet and dilantin .
She was counseled to follow-up with her PCP F 6-12 months regading the right thyroid nodule and the bilateral small lung nodules seen on her chest CT .

Pt was seen by GI on 13 EGD was performed HD2 which was negative for gastritis , stricture or ulcer .
Pt was found to be H. Pylori positive and therefore was started on empiric treatment .
Afferent limb of the roux en y anastamosis was visualized however the efferent limb could not be explored .
Pt had HIDA scan which was negative for obstruction , and CT was unremarkable .
Pt was tolerating regular diet by HD4 , and GI felt that further workup could be continued as an outpatient .
Pt was therefore discharged home in stable condition , voiding , ambulating and eating without difficulty .
Plans to follow up with outpatient MRA to rule out ischemic causes of post prandial pain , as well as HIDA with CK challenge to evaluate for biliary dyskinesia without stasis .
Pt will finish course of H. pylori treatment as well .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
If fevers , chills , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , increasing pain with food please call Dr. Gaetzfreierm &apos;s office or PCP .
If severe , then proceed to ER for evaluation .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a generally healthy 85 year old female , who has had a five year history of right hip pain , worsening over the past several months .
Her pain is located in the groin and thigh .
It is aggravated by activity and improved by sitting or lying down .
It is associated with rest pain as well .
She uses a cane or walker for ambulation , and is limited to one to two blocks .
She does stairs one at a time and only with help .
She has difficulty with shoes and socks and foot care .
The patient &apos;s pain has not been relieved by Darvocet and Advil .
Radiographs demonstrate right hip osteoarthritis .
Having failed conservative management , the patient presented for elective right total hip replacement .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Orthopedic Service on 4/16/93 .
On that day she underwent clearance from the Cardiology Service , Dr. Shuff .
It was his impression that the patient &apos;s hypertension was controlled on hydrochlorothiazide .
Given the patient &apos;s low potassium level of 2.4 on the day of admission , he suggested supplementation with potassium .
The patient was cleared from surgery from a cardiology standpoint .
On the following morning 4/17/93 , the patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent a right total hip replacement , using a hybrid S-ROM system .
Postoperatively , the patient did extremely well .
The patient was seen in consultation with the physical therapy service initially for routine rehabilitation after a total hip replacement .
Her hemovac drains were removed on postoperative day # 2 as was her Foley catheter .
Her hematocrit remained stable in the low to mid 30 &apos;s and she did not require a transfusion .
The patient did have postoperatively hypokalemia to a level of 2.7 and subsequently was corrected with oral and intravenous potassium on 4/22/93 , the patient underwent a duplex ultrasound examination , which showed no evidence of of deep venous thrombosis .
The patient &apos;s Coumadin was thus stopped and she was switched to Bufferin .
The patient &apos;s hospitalization was uncomplicated .
She was discharged to the Encharlea Il Medical Center in New Hampshire .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Robert Mackey is a 49 year old gentleman with a 22 year history of diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of peripheral neuropathy , kidney transplantation in 2003 secondary to diabetic nephropathy , as well as throat cancer in 2004 treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation .
Mr.. Mackey also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy ; a cervical MRI scan showed very impressive disc herniations at C5-C6 , less so at C4-C5 , with clear cut cord compression , particularly on the right side C5-C6 .
Therefore , he was admitted for C4-C5 and C5-C6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
While in the PACU , Anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his SAO2 dropped to 89% .
His respiratory rate was 30 on face mask .
Interoperatively , he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate , although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively .
He responded to intravenous Lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement .
The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume .
No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia , although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction .
He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully .
He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume .
He was also put on Lopressor 150 mg twice a day .
Also in the Intensive Care Unit , O2 saturation was closely monitored .
The patient became agitated with both tent and Bi-PAP machine , although continued to saturate well .
He was transferred to Medicine the morning of 2010-08-30 , for continued medical management post surgery .
On the day of transfer , the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium ; thus , a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants .
1. When his O2 saturation was monitored , his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay .
2. His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued ; those included Temocillin , Nortriptyline , Haldol , Lorazepam , Venlafaxine , Bupropion , and Gabapentin .
In addition , his cyclosporin levels were checked .
3. Hypo or hyperglycemia :
Mahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control .
Finger sticks were in the 150 s when acutely agitated , therefore , it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory .
4. Infectious causes were evaluated .
He was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F. ; yet , chest x-ray , blood cultures , urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources .
A lumbar puncture was considered , although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure .
5. Mass effect was considered , although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium , it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality .
A head and neck CT scan , non-contrast , were ordered though to evaluate for such processes .
No acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted , although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C2 .
This was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery .
6. Trauma was also considered .
The patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma , no loss of consciousness .
Throughout his stay , Chem-10 was monitored .
There were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium .
Liver function tests were checked , only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 .
TSH was within normal limits as was B12 and folate .
RPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked .
The assay was nonreactive .
An EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus , although again this did not seem to be a likely cause .
On the evening of the 22nd , the patient became acutely agitated , threatening to leave , and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving .
Security was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in four-point restraints , for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital .
The restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on 08-31 .
Later in the morning on 08-31 , the patient was more oriented and alert , and asked to have the restraints removed .
They were taken off two at a time .
The patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event .
Intramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered p.r.n. for emergency use should he become acutely agitated .
haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd .
Each progressive day , Mr. Donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on 09-01 .
The likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy .
Other concerns during his stay was his kidney function , due to his renal transplant in 2003 .
His immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay ; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4 ; he has a baseline renal insufficiency .
With this in mind , when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option .
While the patient was in restraints , gentle hydration was initiated since p.o. intake was not adequate .
As for his diabetes mellitus , the Mahoney Team provided updated recommendations each day , adjusting for the changing p.o. intake .
The only other complaints from Mr. Mackey during his stay were :
Soreness at his operative sites , for which he was given p.r.n. Tylenol once his delirium had resolved .
In addition , he also complained of difficulty with swallowing , necessitating only soft and liquid diet .
This was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed 2010-08-27 .
ADMISSION DATE :
03/24/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
03/28/97
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31-year-old right-handed female with right-sided greater than left-sided weakness and difficulty walking for several days .
She was in her usual state of health until 3/20/97 when she experienced the fairly sudden onset of predominantly right-sided arm and leg weakness and ataxia .
She was standing and walking with her friend , who &quot; had to catch her from falling down &quot; as she toppled towards the right .
She evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .
The following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .
In the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of &quot; imbalance &quot; , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .
There was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .
She was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient &apos;s report , had been noted several months earlier .
A magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .
She had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .
Posterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .
On the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .
She was seen by the Psychiatry Service .
She was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .
The psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .
The patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .
This trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .
She will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .
She will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old man who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit status post cardiac arrest .
History was obtained per the Emergency Department report as well as from the patient 's family .
Information was very limited regarding the circumstances of his cardiac arrest .
Reportedly , the patient was at a local restaurant where he was noted to be unresponsive .
EMS was called and reported to arrive on scene within three minutes .
The patient was asystolic but regained a perfusing rhythm after 2 mg of Epinephrine and 2 mg of Atropine .
He was intubated in the field and brought to the Emergency Department .
He remained unresponsive despite the administration of Narcan .
CT examinations of the head , chest , abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable .
Initial chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent interstitium though his lung volumes were low .
Subsequent chest x-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the endotracheal tube .
The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for induced hypothermia given his hemodynamic stability , ongoing unresponsiveness and recent out of hospital cardiac arrest .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac arrest - His arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission .
No further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization .
CT angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism .
The patient had an echocardiogram on 2013-04-26 , which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation ; otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen .
Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest , remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability , he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours .
This was done , however , as in problem number two below , we were not successful in any neurologic recovery .
Neurology - The patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia , the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids .
Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity .
Neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively , loaded with multiple drugs , including Ativan and Propofol drips .
The patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this .
He was loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb coma .
After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb , the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed .
Infectious disease - Over the course of his hospital stay , the patient 's white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17 .
Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia , pneumonia , and urinary tract infection .
For all these infections , the patient was treated with Vancomycin and he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission .
Blood cultures cleared by 2013-05-03 .
Sputum culture as late as 2013-05-10 , however was still positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
The patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of kin .
Ultimately it was decided that the patient 's wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only .
With these goals of care , the patient expired on 2013-05-11 .
The family did consent to a postmortem examination .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 61 - year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 2009-09-11 , who presents for elective right heart catheterization and pericardiocentesis .
The patient did well after his coronary artery bypass graft .
On 10-14 , the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a new , moderate-to-large sized pericardial effusion .
The patient was asymptomatic at this time , and the decision was made to monitor him and to start him on Lasix .
The patient had follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram on 11-04 which revealed a slightly large effusion .
A few days later , on 11-07 , the patient began to develop dyspnea on exertion with normal activity .
He also noted a new two to three-pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
On 11-08 , he had an episode of acute shortness of breath with chest pressure which he describes as different from his typical angina with minimal exertion .
The patient spoke with his cardiologist who referred him for pericardiocentesis for persistent and symptomatic pericardial effusion .
On right heart catheterization , the patient was noted to have elevated right-sided and left-sided filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 and a right atrial pressure of 16 .
After 600 cc of serosanguineous pericardial fluid was removed , the patient was noted to have a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 9 and a right atrial pressure of 2 ; indicating resolution of tamponade physiology .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit after his therapeutic pericardiocentesis .
He was hemodynamically stable and without any complaints .
He was continued on his home cardiac regimen , but was started on indomethacin for post pericardiotomy syndrome .
Over the course of the night the patient drained an additional 400 cc of serosanguineous fluid from his pericardial drain pouch .
By the next morning , the degree of drainage had decreased considerably with only 60 cc drained over six hours .
The patient had a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram prior to drain removal which revealed the following :
A trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion one day post pericardiocentesis with no change from the study immediately post pericardiocentesis .
The pericardial drain was removed without any difficulty .
The pericardial fluid bag was removed without any difficulty with the decision to monitor the patient overnight and repeat the echocardiogram prior to discharge .
The patient had an enlarged left pleural effusion which was noted to layer on a lateral decubitus film .
We decided to perform a therapeutic thoracentesis .
The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion , and 1150 cc of fluid were drained .
A chest x-ray was obtained post thoracentesis which revealed a significant decrease in the size of the left pleural effusion .
No evidence of pneumothorax .
On the morning of admission the patient had a markedly improved lung examination with increased air movement in the left base .
He denied any shortness of breath and had oxygen saturations in the 90 s on room air .
He had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion .
The patient was without any complaints and remained stable .

The diagnosis of Alzheimer &apos;s was made in 1998 .
The patient had an MRI at an outside hospital which showed enlarged lateral ventricles and the possible diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus was entertained and the patient was admitted for diagnostic lumbar puncture .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Arkzie- Memorial for lumbar puncture .
On the night of admission lumbar puncture was attempted on the floor , but we were unable to get cerebral spinal fluid due to difficulty with compliance with the patient who was severely agitated and would not comply with the examination .
On hospital day the patient underwent conscious sedation in the operating room where lumbar puncture was performed .
Opening pressure was 17 and approximately 20-25 cc of CSF was removed .
CSF was notable for sugar level of 65 and total protein level of 56 .
OTHER LABORATORIES THAT WERE NOTABLE :
Vitamin B12 of 855 , folic acid of 15.4 .
Chem-7 was within normal limits .
Tube and requisition of the CSF labeled tube # 1 was notable for color pink , turbidity slight , xanthochromia yes , red blood cells 3,800 , white blood cells 3 , neutrophils 58 , bands 4 , lymphs 29 , monos 6 , eos 2 and basos 1 .
CSF tube labeled # 4 was notable for CSF color pink , CSF turbidity slight , CSF xanthochromia yes , CSF RBCs 3,900 , CSF white blood cells 3 , CSF neutrophils 61 , CSF bands 3 , CSF lymphs 31 , CSF monos 1 , CSF eos 3 , CSF basos 1 .
CSF gram stain was notable for no polys and no organisms seen .
The fluid culture was no growth to date .
One day prior to lumbar puncture , an aerobic culture was similarly pending .
Lyme capture was pending and at the time of discharge .
Other notable tests :
RPR card test was negative .
Because of poor compliance with the gait examination it was very difficult to assess changing gait post lumbar puncture .
The patient &apos;s gait remained wide based and shuffling and requiring assist .
Her mental status remained similarly to her admission examination .
The patient was discharged to home on 11/15/02 with instructions to the family to observe her gait in her home environment and to observe her behavior in her home environment over the next day and to report back to the primary neurologist , Dr. Flythegach , as to changes .

Service :
CCU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 61 - year-old Caucasian-speaking woman with a history of hypercholesterolemia and tobacco use who developed waxing and waning left substernal chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder on 2011-11-17 which lasted that entire day .
Upon waking on the morning of admission , she had 10/10 chest pain associated with nausea .
She presented to Charlton Memorial Hospital Hospital Emergency Department with inferior ST elevations ; at which time she became acutely hypotensive to a systolic blood pressure of 70 to 80 after receiving one ublingual nitroglycerin .
She then became bradycardic which responded to atropine and intravenous fluids .
In addition , she was given aspirin , Plavix , heparin , and morphine .
Immediately prior to transfer to Worcester State Hospital , she went into ventricular fibrillation arrest at 12:30 p.m. , at which time she was intubated and defibrillated back to sinus rhythm after five shocks .
She received an amiodarone bolus of 150 mg intravenously and was continued on an amiodarone drip while CMED CSRU-flighted to Boston Regional Medical Center_ where she underwent a catheterization .
The cardiac catheterization revealed a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery and diffuse right coronary artery disease .
She received three stents to the right coronary artery which was complicated by a proximal dissection .
She had good post percutaneous coronary intervention angiographic results .
Incidentally , an aortogram during the catheterization revealed a Debakey class I aortic ascending aneurysm , and the patient had a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20 at the time of catheterization .
She was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit in stable condition and still intubated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM :
On the night of admission , the patient experienced post catheterization hypotension which required intravenous fluids and dopamine .
Electrocardiogram the following morning revealed normalization of her ST segments with evolution of Q waves .
Her dopamine was weaned off the following day , and her heparin was discontinued secondary to a right groin hematoma which had developed after the sheath had been pulled out by the fellow .
Her creatine kinases climbed ; reaching a peak of 3523 , which was down to 1500 at the time of discharge .
Also noted on the day of 11-20 , the patient self-extubated herself .
For her coronary artery disease , status post catheterization , she was given Integrilin for 18 hours .
She was continued on aspirin , Plavix , and Lipitor .
For her rhythm , amiodarone was discontinued as she was maintained in sinus rhythm after moving to the floor .
For pump , once transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit on 2011-11-20 , a beta blocker was begun at 12.5 mg of Lopressor p.o. b.i.d. which was titrated to 25 mg at the time of discharge .
Also , at the time of discharge , for increased afterload reduction , she was started on lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
On 2011-11-21 , the patient experienced atypical chest pain which was made worse with inspiration and movement .
It was not associated with any nausea or vomiting .
It did not radiate .
It was felt to be pain secondary to her self-extubation and noncardiac chest pain .
An electrocardiogram was checked which revealed no ST changes , and there was no increase in her downward trending creatine phosphokinases .
No further intervention was done .
The patient was treated with Tylenol orally as well as Ativan for anxiety that she had about going home .
She was pain free on the day of discharge .
Regarding her aortic ascending aneurysm , Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted regarding further workup .
At their request , a CT scan of the chest with contrast was performed on the day of discharge .
Dr. Streeter from Cardiothoracic Surgery will follow up with the patient for further management in approximately one month as an outpatient .
His office will contact her to make that appointment .
2. PULMONARY SYSTEM :
As stated above , the patient self-extubated herself .
She complained of a sore throat which was likely the etiology of her atypical chest complaints .
This resolved with Tylenol and as needed doses of oxycodone .
Her lungs remained clear to auscultation bilaterally throughout the remainder of her hospital course .
At the time of this dictation , the CT of her chest was still pending .
The official result was not yet in .
3. FLUIDS / ELECTROLYTES / NUTRITION :
The patient 's electrolytes sere managed daily and repleted on an as needed basis .
She did receive intravenous K-Phos for a low phosphorous of 1.5 .
Her phosphorous rose appropriately to 3.6 at the time of discharge .

MEDICINE
History of Present Illness :
42 year old female with h/o cholangiocarcinoma dx in 2009 s/p resection , with recent CT showing met cholangiocarcinoma in 9/2004 .
Pt was recently admitted for fever due to cholangitis on 10-18 and had chemo ( CDDP and Gemcitabine ) on Monday , 10-21 .
Since chemo pt has intermittent nausea adequately controlled by zofran and compazine .
Pt was doing well till night of admission when she developed nausea / vomitting and sizable amount of hemoptysis and clots .
Has low grade fever since chemo but otherwise ROS was neg for shaking chills , chest pain , SOB , coughing , constipation , diarrhea , tarry stools , abd pain .
Pt has reported gaining 30 lbs since 08-31 due to ascites .
In Monica : vitals : T 98.8 P 98 BP 136/68 R 29 Sat 98% RAPt had NG lavage which evantually cleared up , also was transfused 1U PRBC , GI consult called , also got zofran and iv protonix .
Brief Hospital Course :
1) GI - In the Monica pt had Hct of 20 and bloody NG lavage which did not clear .
She was transfused 1U PRBC , GI consult called , also got zofran and iv protonix and admitted to the FICU .
On arrival to unit pt had EGD which revealed grade III esophageal varices with signs of old bleeding .
She was started on octreotide and nadolol to control portal htn .
Pt was stable and had appropriate Hct bump to 25 after 2U PRBC 's.
She also had climbing bilirubin and low grade temp and was started on Zosyn for suspected biliary obstruction and ascending cholangitis coverage .
She was rescoped on 10-28 and varices were sclerosed ( no banding due to latex allergy ) and diuretics of lasix and aldactone were readded for ascites since BP stable .
10-29 she was transfused another 3U PRBC 's with hct bump to 31.9 and antibiotic coverage broadend to Unasyn , Ceftriaxone , Flagyl because she continued to spike , and for SBP prophylaxis .
Preprocedure of PTC on 10-30 she was transfused 1 unit PRBC 's, 2 platelets and 2U FFP and procedure went without complication .
ON transfer to the floor she remained hemodynamically stable with stable Hct and declining bilirubin .
She remained afebrile so on 11-02 antibiotic regimen was weaned to only levofloxacin .
Liver teams recommended to repeat EGD with non latex banding in 7-10 days .
She also went home on naldolol 20 mg qd for portal htn , and her home doses of diuretics to control her ascites .
2. US finding - Pt was incidentally found to have R hydronephrosis and a R adenexal mass on her US .
The hydronephrosis was likely caused by blockage by her tumor .
Given her disease prognosis and the fact that her other kidney is functioning well , no intervention was done .
Also the adenexal mass may represent a second primary maligancy .
This was seen on a prior CT scan and her oncologist is aware .
Again given the patient 's poor disease prognosis , there was no intervention made at this time .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 76 year old white male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia .
He was most recently discharged from Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to Linghs County Medical Center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 .
The patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area .
The patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter .
The patient was brought to the Emergency Room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by Urology and had his catheter changed .
The patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway .
On the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath .
The patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day .
The patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum .
He also denies any chest pain .
No orthopnea .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
The patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home .
By the time the patient arrived at the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room he was in moderate respiratory distress .
His initial blood gases on 40% 02 was P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 .
The patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered Do Not Resuscitate .
The patient was not intubated .
However he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of Albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics .
A chest x-ray in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs .
There were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe .
These were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Associated medical problems include :
1. Atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube .
2. Anxiety .
3. Coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past .
4. History of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Ativan 1 mg po twice a day .
2. Trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day .
3. Xalatan 0.005% one gtt left eye qhs .
4. Brimonidine 1 gtt left eye three times a day .
5. Combivent 3 puffs four times per day .
6. Aerobid three puffs twice a day .
7. Sorbitol 30 cc every other day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was an elderly frail gentleman in moderate respiratory distress .
He had a blood pressure 110/70 , heart rate 110 beats per minute and regular , respiratory rate 25 .
He was in moderate respiratory distress .
His temperature was 98F .
He had a normal head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam .
Neck exam revealed no jugular venous distention and no masses .
Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as crackles in the bases .
There were no wheezes or rhonchi .
Heart exam revealed a soft S1 and S2 , no murmur was heard , no S3 .
Abdomen was soft , nontender with no masses palpable .
Rectal exam was unremarkable with stool heme negative .
Neurological exam revealed an alert and oriented x 3 elderly male .
He moved all extremities .
Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical in all extremities .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Sodium 148 , potassium 3.4 , glucose 174 , P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 on 40% 02 .
Blood urea nitrogen 11 , creatinine .6 , uric acid 3.0 , alkaline phosphatase 78 , creatinine phosphokinase isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 .
Urine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells .
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
He stayed in the unit for about one day .
During that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with Albuterol .
He was also started on intravenous Ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia .
He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2L urine output on the first day and 1.5L the second day .
After one day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment .
This consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous Solu-Medrol .
As the patient &apos;s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved .
A chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe .
The patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia .
The antibiotic chosen was Levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day .
This was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days .
The Ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia .
The patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal .
It was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then .
The patient &apos;s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with Lasix .
While in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in Cimetidine while in the Intensive Care Unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease .
The patient was upgraded to Prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease .
The patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient &apos;s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to Prilosec .
While in Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently .
It is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living .
Discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home .
They wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient &apos;s respiratory status was stable .
I think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had .
He needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for Physical Therapy to increase his muscle strength .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h .
2. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day .
3. Ativan .5 mg twice a day .
4. Nasal oxygen 3L per minute .
5. Levaquin 500 mg per day to be continued until 4/12/99 .
6. Lasix 40 mg per day .
7. Prednisone 40 mg per day to be tapered over two weeks .
8. Xalatan eyedrops 1 gtt in left eye per day .
9. Alphagan 1 gtt in left eye three times a day .
10. Trusopt 1gtt in left eye three times a day .
11. Prilosec 20 mg per day .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient should have follow up with his primary care physician Dr. Rod Linkeboltshieltrus at the TRE 453 about one week after discharge from rehab facility .
The telephone number at his office is 236-4518 .

Discharge Date :
08/18/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 88 year-old woman undergoing treatment for a right lower extremity cellulitis who was transferred from Child for worsening cellulitis and new confusion .
The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and was recently admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center for a Nafcillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis of the right leg treated with a course of Nafcillin and Levofloxacin .
There was also a right leg fluid collection that was incised and drained on August 1 , 1998 .
The patient was sent to rehabilitation on Levofloxacin orally .
Although details were not available at the time of admission , apparently , she had done well until the 24 hours proceeding admission when the cellulitis was felt to be worsening .
She had also been noted to be confused and combative during that 24 hour period .
As her baseline mental status is completely alert and oriented , this caused concern amongst the staff of the rehabilitation center and the patient was transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Mental status changes :
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .
A neurologic work-up was undertaken which included a CT scan of the head which revealed no acute bleed and a lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 72 , protein 65 , white blood cell count 19 , red blood cell count 11,500 with no evidence of xanthrochromasia .
The Neurology Service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection , her multiple medications , or her metabolic condition .
The patient &apos;s mental status slowly began to recover , however on the morning of the first day of admission , August 16 , 1998 , the patient was found after having fallen .
A neurological examination was performed which revealed no abnormality and imaging included a head scan which revealed no bleed and a cervical spine series which revealed degenerative joint disease but no obvious fracture .
The patient decided not to pursue further testing with a neck CT scan .
At the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s mental status is back to its baseline .
2) Right lower extremity cellulitis :
The patient was evaluated by the Surgical Service who felt that the wound was clean with some erythema but without evidence of true cellulitis .
The patient &apos;s antibiotics were discontinued with the thought that prolonged antibiotics only put her at more risk for infection .
3) Cardiac :
The patient has a history of critical aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation .
Fortunately , these issues were not active during the present admission .
4) Status post fall :
The patient did fall while inhouse .
A head CT scan and cervical spine series were negative .
The patient appeared to have no deficits at the time of discharge .
5) Atrial fibrillation :
The patient &apos;s Coumadin was continued .
6) Abnormal liver function tests :
On admission , the patient was noted to have elevated bilirubins in the 3 range and mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase consistent with a cholestatic picture .
These liver function tests will be followed closely as an outpatient .
Admission Date :
03/17/1998
Discharge Date :
04/12/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 68 year old with acute leukemia .
The patient was in her usual state of health until about three weeks prior to admission when she began to notice increased weakness and bruising .
She presented to a Wood Emergency Department six days prior to admission .
Platelets were 9,000 , hemoglobin 9.5 , temperature was 100.4 .
The patient had a smear there consistent with ALL .
The patient was transferred to Norri Hospital .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
No headache , no nausea , vomiting or diarrhea .
Some shortness of breath with allergies , particularly cats .
No chest pain .
The patient had been doing aerobics three times a week until a couple of weeks before admission .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
A Hickman catheter was placed and the patient was begun on chemotherapy .
The regimen included cyclophosphamide , daunorubicin , prednisone , Vincristine and PEG-asparaginase .
The patient tolerated the chemotherapy regimen well .
The patient began neutropenic on day five of induction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests began to rise and she began to experience pulmonary symptoms including increased crackles .
The patient began to spike and a blood culture grew out Staphylococcusaureus .
The patient was begun on Gentamicin , Vancomycin and Piperacillin , which was changed to Gentamicin and Ceftazidime .
The patient continued to spike and was enrolled in a randomized trial , the patient was randomized to AmBisome antifungal treatment .
An abdominal MRI was performed to assess continued elevated liver enzymes ; however , the MRI was negative .
The patient was begun on Nafcillin due to continued spiking .
The patient began to experience urinary retention and was straight catheterized .
Thepatient developed a possible drug rash and Nafcillin was changed to Ancef .
The patient became constipated ; this resolved with laxatives .
The patient improved significantly and was thought to be ready for discharge by the 11th of April .
She will follow up with her primary oncologists , Dr A and Dr Dark , at IVMC , after her discharge .

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 91 yo woman with h/o HTN who came from Bridgewater State Hospital Rehab with substernal chest pain after exercise .
Pt had been in her usual state of health and performed here regular exercises .
After returning to her room she w noted SSCP without radiation .
No nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis .
They did an ECG at Bridgewater State Hospital rehab which demonstarted new ST depressions in V1-V4 .
She received ASA 81 mg x 2 and nitro SL x 2 with partial relief at nursing home .
On presentation to Providence Behavioral Health Hospital Amanda , her vitals were HR 68 , BP 142/68 , RR 28 , O2 sat 100% RA .
Exam was notable for RRR with no murmur , bibasilar crackles , guaiac negative .
EKG showed sinus brady , with old LAD and new ST depressions in V1-V4 .
Troponin was 0.07 .
She received ASA , nitro SL then gtt , morphine , metoprolol , and heparin gtt .
Cardiology discussed cath however , patient 's family turned down .
Transferred to CCU for further management and observation .
Brief Hospital Course:
INITIAL IMPRESSION :
90 year-old woman with h/o of HTN p/w substernal chest pain shortly after exercise at nursing home , with EKG showing ST depressions in V1-V4 and troponin 0.07.
Likely NSTEMI .
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
.
* CV :
The patient 's family refused coronary artery catheterization .
The patient was given ASA , Plavix , heparin drip x 24 hours , nitro drip , atorvastatin , metoprolol , and lisinopril .
Her chest pain was controlled with morphine .
Her SBP remained in the 160s-170s on hospital day 1 and she was gently diuresed .
On hospital day 2 she experienced atrial fibrillation with HR in the 140s .
Her metoprolol dose was increased from 25 mg PO bid to 50 mg PO bid then 75 mg PO tid .
Her HR decreased to 70s-80s .
Her BP remained stable .
An ECHO showed that she had preserved EF and no wall motion abnormalities .
We decided given her age that she would not be a good candidate for cardioversion for her afib nor would she be a good candidate for coumadin .
Therefore we will continue rate control with metoprolol this can be titrated if needed , and aspirin and plavix for anti-coagulation .
She should also continue on lipitor and lisinopril .
She should have her chem 7 checked next week given the start of her new meds .
Will also need LFT 's checked in 3-6 months .
.
* Pulmonary :
Bilateral crackles at bases and midlungs , elevated JVP , trace bilateral ankle edema , and CXR with diffuse opacities suggest possible pulmonary edema , likely secondary to acute MI .
Her O2 sat was stable at 94-97% on 2.5L of supplemental O2 .
She experienced no respiratory difficulty during the hospital stay .
She was diuresed small amount .
Her CXR prior to discharge showed mild pulm edema and thus was given 40 of lasix prior to going to rehab .
She can be given prn lasix for weight gain or shortness of breath .
.
* Leukocytosis- She developed mild elevated WBC .
UA had 12-14
WBC 's , few bacteria .
She was initially started on Bactrim , but this was stopped as she was afebrile .
SHe has a culture pending which needs to be followed up at the nursing home and treated if positive .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 83-year-old female who presents for surgical evaluation for her hyperparathyroidism .
This is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy , status post mitral valve replacement in 1988 , chronic atrial fibrillation , hypertension , who presents for parathyroidectomy .
In August of 1996 while the patient was at Retelk County Medical Center for replacement of her knees bilaterally , and on preoperative evaluation she was noted to have a high calcium and therefore the surgery was canceled .
Further testing revealed hyperparathyroidism as evidenced by an elevated PTH .
The patient reports no masses in her neck .
She has noticed some generalized hoarseness in her voice for the past 5-6 months .
In addition , she has some dysphagia , particularly has had some difficulties with swallowing .
She has been seen by Dr. Tokbelb , her primary care physician in Itgreenredan Hospital , and also Dr. Kotefyfechird , her cardiologist , and also an endocrinologist at Retelk County Medical Center .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On the day of admission , the patient was brought to the operating room for parathyroidectomy .
The right superior parathyroid gland was found to be markedly enlarged and consistent with an adenoma .
Her right superior parathyroid gland was removed and the rest of her parathyroid glands were left in place .
Postoperatively , the patient did well and was able to cough and phonate completely with no changes from preoperative .
The plan was to start her on heparin and Coumadin and discontinue her heparin when her Coumadin levels became therapeutic as judged by the prothrombin time / INR .
However , on postoperative day number two , the patient in the afternoon noticed some tingling in her hands and also some tingling hear her perioral region .
She had a negative Chvostek &apos;s and negative Trousseau &apos;s sign .
She had no muscular weakness noted .
An ionized calcium was drawn which was low at 1.0 .
As a result , the patient was started on Os-Cal 250 mg PO q.i.d. On postoperative day number three , her ionized calcium was 1.06 and her Os-Cal was increased to 500 q.i.d.
However , her ionized calcium decreased to 0.97 and she was given one amp of calcium gluconate .
On postoperative day number five , the patient felt fine and had an INR of 1.9 with a prothrombin time of 16.6 .
Her calcium was 8.5 , albumin 3.6 , and phosphate 4.5 .
She had had no further episodes of tingling in her fingers after the initial episode which had prompted us originally to draw the ionized calcium .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Breunlinke is a 69 year-old right handed woman , status post surgical correction of a C-1 to C-2 dural AVM in January , 1998 , now presenting with a one month history of increasing left sided weakness and pain with spasticity , occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain .
She was originally admitted to the Verg Medical Center in January , 1998 , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity .
She was found to have intermedullary lesion at C1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected .
The postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention .
She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery .
As of the beginning of September , 1999 , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ) .
Functionally , she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support .
Over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated .
She is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up .
Her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact .
She has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she has lost ten pounds .
She denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency .
Over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently .
The patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum .
This pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On admission , a CT scan of the head with and without contrast was performed , showing a missing posterior arch at C-1 and metallic clips at the craniocervical junction consistent with prior surgical intervention .
No arteriovenous malformations are identified ; there is no evidence of recurrence of her former vascular malformation .
No intraspinal lesions are identified .
Upon further review of Dr. Laymie Fields , Department of Neuroradiology , review of the cervical spine on CT reveals no extrinsic compressive lesions impacting the spinal cord and no enhancing lesions of the spinal cord with contrast .
Angiography performed on October 31 , 1999 , showed normal vascular distribution of the head and neck with no recurrence of arteriovenous malformation .
During this admission , the patient was started on Baclofen 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for spasticity .
Coumadin was discontinued .
The patient was given aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
The patient was also given Valium 5-10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for muscle spasm .
She was continued on Demerol 50 mg q 6-8 hours p.r.n. for left arm and leg pain .
Upon further review of CT and angiography results with Neuroradiology and Neurology service , it was decided that CT myelography was not indicated at this time .
Note , the patient is not a candidate for magnetic resonance imaging secondary to ferromagnetic intracardiac pacing device .

Admission Date :
02/08/1991
Discharge Date :
02/18/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
Mr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .
He was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
He was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .
On 02/06/91 , he was seen in FLFDMC and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .
He was evaluated in the Emergency Room .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .
Cultures were taken and he was sent out .
On 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
He was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .
However , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .
On 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
No other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.

At that time had UE duplex which revealed RUE DVT involving IJ , Axillary , subclav , brachial , and basilic veins .
Then referred to ER for Tx
Brief Hospital Course :
Pt admitted 05-24 from ER after positive RUE DVT finding in vascular lab .
During ER evaluation pt was noted to have some degree of dyspnea as well as mental status changes , including loss of short term memory and brief unresponsive period after one dose of IV Benadry and steroids prior to CT scan .
The CT was negative for CVA but positive for Pulmonary embolism .
He was transferred to CSRU for evaluation .
Neurology was consulted and the pt also had MRI which was negative .
The pt was begun on heparin gtt and was noted to have platelet drop > 50% after infusion began , hepain was d/c 'd.
Argatroban was started abd a HIT panel was sent , HIT panel was positive .
Hematology was consulted .
By the following mornig all mental status changes had cleared and the pt was transferred to the floors for continued care .
Over the next several days the patient was maintained on Argatroban when coumadin therapy was initiated .
On HD#6 the pt had a therapeudic INR ( 4.4 ) off Argatroban and wad discharged home .
He was to have f/u INR check with Dr Lewis on 05-31 .
Additionally the pt should f/u with the hematology clinic .

ADMISSION DATE :
12/11/2003
DISCHARGE DATE :
01/08/2004
The patient has a known history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma .
He is admitted at this time because of significant GI bleeding .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Significant for fatigue and increased abdominal discomfort .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION :
Insulin , Celexa , Protonix , Ambien and Pancreas .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs showed his blood pressure to be slightly decreased at 120/60 , pulse 64 , respirations 16 , temperature 98.8 , O2 sat 95 .
HEENT :
Evidence of anemia with being pale , but anicteric , no oral lesions .
Neck supple .
Lungs clear .
Back without CVA or spinal tenderness .
Heart regular rate and rhythm .
Abdomen :
Bowel sounds positive , soft , mildly tender in the epigastrium without hepatosplenomegaly , mass or tenderness .
Extremities :
Trace edema without cyanosis or clubbing .
His hematocrit at the time of admission was 20.5 , after having been 32 one week earlier .
ASSESSMENT :
The assessment was that he had a GI bleed .
He was transfused and then evaluated by GI .
Endoscopy showed multiple angio ectasias throughout the stomach .
He received multiple treatments for this over the succeeding weeks .
In addition , he was transfused .
His platelet count was maintained with platelet transfusion as necessary .
He was treated with Octreotide to try to slow down the bleeding .
Despite all these measures , his bleeding was never totally controlled .
He then had an angiogram with Gel foam to try to control his GI bleed .
Again , this was unsuccessful .
At that point he had a change in mental status and was no longer responsive .
Given this , the decision was made to make his care comfort measures only .
At this point , he was made comfort measures and expired comfortably .
The cause of death was a combination of GI bleeding felt to be ultimately related to his known metastatic pancreatic cancer .

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
64-year-old G5P5 postmenopausal for 10 years with a history of two months of progressive abdominal distention , crampy abdominal pain , urinary frequency and diarrhea .
The patient has not obtained gynecologic care for 32 years until April 2004 when an increase in abdominal GERD and urinary symptoms lead her to initial consultation with Dr. Lentny Farstnappsshee in Gobrew Street , Denlandcobridclevena , West Virginia 28880 .
At that time a pelvic ultrasound was performed showing extensive fluid and clear mass within the pelvi-abdominal cavity .
MRI showed a large fluid filled abdomen with a relatively small mass measuring about 5 to 6 cm in the right pelvis .
At this point she had an elevated CA 125 at 440 and came to Dr. Chabechird for further consultation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on 05/16/2004 for bowel preparation before the surgery .
On 05/17/2004 the patient underwent atotal abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingooophorectomy , bilateral node dissection , omentectomy , lysis of adhesions , removal of mass from surface of transverse colon .
The report from the frozen section sent in the surgery came back with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma , possibly serous carcinoma of the ovary .
In the postoperative recovery room the patient had a hematocrit of 29.2 with low urine output .
She was given 1 unit of packed red blood cell .
Her urine output subsequently increased .
The patient was transferred to the floor without any complications .
She had an uneventful night .
On postoperative day one , the patient &apos;s urine culture came back with moderate E. coli .
She was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg po daily .
The patient was also started on a clear diet .
On postoperative day two , her Foley was discontinued .
The patient was out of bed .
She was tolerating liquids .
On postoperative day three , the patient had a port placed .
She also had one episode of shortness of breath .
Achest x-ray done at that time showed left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion , not pulmonary edema and left lower lobe consolidations .
The patient was afebrile , her vital signs were stable and she maintained a good urine output .
She also had an episode of nausea with some emesis , after being treated with Zofran with no relief , a nasogastric tube was placed which drained 1200 cc of bilious fluid .
On postoperative day four , the patient continued to have nasogastric tube in place .
A repeat chest x-ray done for dyspnea showed persistent pleural effusion with atelectasis versus pneumonia .
Her levofloxacin was continued .
The patient tolerated nasogastric tube clamping trials with high residuals in the 600 cc range .
The patient did well on postoperative day five and six .
She was started on clear fluids with a nasogastric clamped .
On postoperative day seven the patient diet was slowly advanced as tolerated .
She was also started on Decadron in preparation for her chemotherapy .
On postoperative day eight which is Memorial Day the patient was started on Carboplatin-Taxolchemo therapy , which she tolerated without complication .
On postoperative nine , her JP drain was discontinued .
The patient was discharged home that afternoon in stable condition in the afternoon .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 61 year old male with a history of diabetes , coronary artery disease , hepatitis C , and asthma who was diagnosed recently with pancreatic cancer after he presented to Seph&apos;sju Memorial after a motor vehicle accident .
Chest CT revealed a pulmonary nodule .
Abdominal CT revealed a 3.0 to 4.0 centimeter lesion in the pancreatic head .
An ERCP performed there showed a long segment of distal narrowing of the common bileduct and a transhepatic biliary drain was placed there on December 29 .
On January 1 , a chest tube was placed for a loculated pleural effusion .
On January 2 , pleurodesis was performed .
On January 4 , he had a desaturation .
VQ was indeterminate .
LENIs were negative at that time .
On January 5 , he had a chest xray with a left apicalpneumothorax but was stable on chest xray of January 7 .
Brain CT was negative , as was a bronchoscopy with lavage .
His CA99 was normal .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The patient had reported an approximately 30 pound weight loss in six weeks .
He had experienced some constipation for the few months prior with lighter colored stools , darkened urine and fatigue for months with increased shortness of breath , orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion .
He denied any fevers , chills or night sweats .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Gastrointestinal .
The patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .
The drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by IR , when it was accidentally removed .
Increased flow again .
The patient had signs and symptoms develop of SBP , also with an elevated white count .
He was treated broadly with amp , levo and Flagyl .
Cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .
The patient &apos;s abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .
Clinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .
He underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .
This had to be performed by IR because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .
He received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on Levofloxacin IV for prophylaxis against SBP .
2. Pulmonary .
From a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .
His apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .
Chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .
However , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .
On the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .
Chest xray is still consistent with volume overload .
The plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .
3. Cardiovascular .
He had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Echocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .
He did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .
4. Endocrine .
Diabetes .
His Avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile .
He is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin .
5. Heme .
From a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated PT INR .
He required a few transfusions during his hospital course .
He also required FFP initially to reverse his coagulopathy .
However , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .
His INR normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on Lovenox .
6. Renal .
He had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .
From his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .
However , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .
At the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .
His appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .
7. ID .
Please see GI .
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical SBP .
He will be maintained on Levofloxacin for prophylaxis against SBP .
Given that he will need continued taps,
8. Oncology .
The patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .
However , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .
His pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .
As he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .
Discussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .
Code status - the patient is a DNR / DNI .
This is an unfortunate case but Mr. Po does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort .

The patient is a 47 - year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease , status post 2-vessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 2005 , 3-vessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 2009 , hypertension , new onset type 2 diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia who presents with the sudden onset of substernal chest pain status post exercise .
The patient presented to Bournewood Hospital on the morning of admission with a chief complaint of substernal burning without radiation which developed while doing exercise .
Of note , this is the second time the patient has exercised in many months .
The pain became worse over the next few minutes to 07-12 and increased to 10-12 while he was in the ambulance .
His nitroglycerin patch did not help , and he only had slight relief with sublingual nitroglycerin times three .
In addition , he had slight shortness of breath but denies headache , change in vision , dizziness , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , change in bowel or urinary habits , or fevers , chills , and sweats .
Of note , he had a negative stress test in 2012-07-03 .
He was sent to Bournewood Hospital via ambulance .
In the Emergency Department he received aspirin , nitroglycerin drip , heparin drip , Dilaudid , and TNK with decreased in his pain but without resolution of symptoms .
Electrocardiogram at that time showed ST elevations and J point elevations in V2 through V4 .
The patient was transferred to Sturdy Memorial where he underwent catheterization .
Catheterization results showed 100% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery and 50% stenosis of first diagonal .
Angio-Jet percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting was performed on proximal left anterior descending artery and the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed on first diagonal with good results .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed at this time as well .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The Mass. Mental Health Center hospital course was unremarkable .
Dopamine was discontinued on day one .
The intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on day two .
The patient was continued on heparin throughout his hospital course and transitioned to Coumadin on hospital day four .
The patient was continued on Lipitor and aspirin , and Plavix was added and will be continued for 30 days post catheterization .
The patient was continued on Lopressor and captopril throughout his hospital course , and changed to

History of Present Illness :
Mr. Lockley is a 73 yo male with a complicated past medical history , recently discharged from St. Margaret 's Center for Women & Infants on 08-02 following a prolonged admission for STEMI , respiratory failure felt secondary to pulmonary edema requiring intubation and subsequent tracheostomy 02-22 failure to wean , sepsis and C.difficile colitis treated with Vancomycin and Flagyl with a course of Levophed .
He was discharged to Athol Memorial Hospital for continued weaning .
Per Dr. John C. Corrigan Mental Health Center , patient remained ventilator dependent , intermittently on PS 20/5 and back on AC 15/5/500/0.35 on 08-08 .
At OSH , sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and MRSA , and he was restarted on Zosyn ( 08-08 ) and Vancomycin ( 08-09 ).
He completed his course of Vancomycin on 2017-08-10 .
However , today around 17:45 , while being moved by the nursing staff , Mr. Lockley Bosche started coughing .
Suctioned X 1 , mucus not cleared .
He then became dusky and cyanotic , and stopped breathing on his own .
A code was called , + pulse .
Patient placed on FiO2 100% .
Vitals reportedly HR 88-98 , BP 150/80 .
ABG done on FiO2 100% 7.36/66/417/98% .
At Vencor Hospital , BP dropped to 90 , and patient was started on NS IVF , with improvement in BP .
EKG without acute changes .
He was transferred to St. Margaret 's Center for Women & Infants John for further management on AC , RR 15 , PEEP 5 , Vt 500 , Fi02 1.0 .
In John , BP 80/60 , HR 80 .
Continued on IVF ( received total 2300 cc ) , with improved BP to SBP 105-118 .
Stool sent for C.diff and given Flagyl 500 mg PO X 1 dose .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Lockley was admitted with respiratory failure , thought to be related to mucus plugging as well as a pseudomonal pneumonia .
Both of these etiologies were treated , and he continued to oxygenate and ventilate well on his usual ventilator settings .
However , the issue that dominated the admission was his recent acute decline in mental status .
He was thoroughly evaluated by neurology and underwent head CT , MRI , LP , and EEG .
This work-up demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct , likely cardioembolic .
However , they felt this event could not account for his new , severe global deficit ; this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process , likely anoxic encephalopathy , for which the prognosis is extremely grim .
This was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient 's wife , son , primary care doctor , ICU attending , and neurology consultant in the presence of a Asian interpreter .
The end result of these discussion was that the patient 's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery ; the family decided to make him comfort measures only .
He was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped , and he expired shortly thereafter .
The family was present .
Admission Date :
02/10/1998
Discharge Date :
02/26/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69 year-old white gentleman who is status post a coronary artery bypass graft in 1985 with a large anterior septal myocardial infarction intraoperatively .
Two years after this operation , he required a pacer implantation for sick sinus syndrome .
The patient presents now with progressive dyspnea , but no anginal pain .
Ejection fraction was noted to be 20% .
He is status post multiple angioplasty stents .
He presents now for possible reoperative coronary artery bypass graft .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Verg Medical Center .
Subsequent exercise treadmill test demonstrated no evidence of ischemia by EKG .
The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room where he underwent a reoperative coronary artery bypass graft times three with a subaortic proximal graft from the aorta to the OM1 and then OM2 and aorta to the LAD with a wide graft per Dr. Lumar Jongguild .
Postoperatively , the patient was ventilated .
The patient was weaned off an Epinephrine drip .
Rhythm became more stable .
Balloon was weaned and finally discontinued .
The patient was extubated .
His Melranon was weaned off and his ACE inhibitor began .
The patient was started on Amiodarone and diuresed .
The patient &apos;s lower extremities began to swell and the patient was begun on Hirudin for deep venous thrombosis .
The patient &apos;s heparin induced thrombocytopenia became positive and so he is allergic to heparin .
The patient was begun on Coumadin and he stayed several days for Coumadinization and was finally discharged on therapeutic Coumadin .
The patient tolerated a regular diet on postoperative day number thirteen from his reoperative coronary artery bypass graft .

In 2003 , he had a non ST elevation MI , came to the RWH , and had a cath done , which showed a 40% RCA , which was hazy .
An IVUS was done , and it was felt that it was more severe .
He underwent a PTC stenting of an RCA with a Vision stent , 3 x 18 .
Diagonal 1 also had a 99% stenosis .
There was no other noted disease .
Since then , the patient has occasional chest pain with emotional stress , when he is angry or upset .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 58 year old female with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease for more than twenty years who presented to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center with a revolving anterolateral wall myocardial infarction on 08-01-93 .
She has been under the care of Dr. Aalv Manual and was referred here for further therapy .
She had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor &apos;s office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain .
Her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .
The patient was transferred to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center and was admitted .
Her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .
In addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 .
She developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support .
She underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .
She had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease .
The main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .
The left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .
The circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis .
Cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .
The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .
The patient was transferred to the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for consideration of coronary angioplasty .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is remarkable for a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in no acute distress .
The blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury .
Her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .
The jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle .
The carotids were normal .
The chest was clear .
The cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line .
The first sound was normal .
The second sound was normally split .
She had no murmurs and no gallops .
The examination the abdomen was benign .
The examination of the extremities showed no edema .
She had good pulses bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
Her electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor R-wave progression in V1 through V4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction .
There were prominent Q-waves in AVL , consistent with lateral myocardial infarction .
There were non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Department because of the history of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
The patient was maintained on intravenous heparin .
On 8-17-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending .
Following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty .
Therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
She was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 08-18-93 for a relook coronary angiography .
Coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy .
Specifically , there was no decrease in the initial gain that she achieved after directional atherectomy .
The patient remained stable during the rest of the hospitalization .
She was transferred in stable condition to the Pasi for further rehabilitation therapy .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .
He underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .
In 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
A workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .
He has been on Decadron since 08/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .
He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .
There was evidence of cord compression .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to Lorough Medical Center &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .

Abdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
Rectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .
Extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .
There was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .
Neurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , Retelk County Medical Center , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .
Cranial nerves intact .
Motor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .
Strength was decreased in both lower extremities .
Coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .
Glucose 191 .
PT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .
Magnesium 1.7 .
UA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .
Chest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
There was no CSF density .
These findings were consistent with the cord compression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .
In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

Admission Date :
01/12/1991
Discharge Date :
01/20/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was in her usual state of excellent health until July of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
Subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
On 12/23 , she was seen by Dr. Stonge at Bri Health where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
A fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
Subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
On 1/5 , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at Bri Health under local anesthesia .
The pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .
This prompted further staging work-up .
The patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at Bri Health which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
There was no obvious GIor pancreatic tumor identified .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
A specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .
The patient was transferred to Nimaconwood Valley Hospital for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .
Over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .
She has had no motor weakness , abnormal sensation , numbness , tingling or incontinence of bowel or bladder .
She denied fevers , chills or sweats .
There has been no GI or GU symptoms except for constipation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on 1/13/91 .
The work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
A bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .
Ahead CT scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the right vertex of the calvarium but no intracranial abnormalities .
Work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .
The abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed no suspicious GI masses , no pancreatic mass ; a 2 cm ovarian cyst .
The review of the pathology from Bri Health confirmed a high grade adenocarcinoma .
Erica and basic cystic protein stains are still pending .
Serum markers were normal .
The CEA was less than 0.7 .
The hCG on admission was 30,710 and on 1/19 was 805 .
The CA-125 was still pending and alphafeto protein is still pending .
Hypercalcemia :
The patient presented with a serum calcium of 11.8 and an albumin of 2.3 on admission .
She received three days of intravenous etidronate with normal saline diuresis and the serum calcium subsequently decreased to 9.0 .
The patient was then switched to po etidronate .
IVC obstruction :
The patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by CT scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic IVC .
This has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .
The patient &apos;s low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .
Hypoxia and shortness of breath :
Although the patient &apos;s room air saturation was 96% during this admission , she subjectively complained of increased shortness of breath .
It was felt that the patient &apos;s extensive pulmonary metastases and bilateral pleural effusions resulted in increased work of respiration and a sensation of shortness of breath .
Impending spinal cord compression :
The patient had back pain on admission without any focal neurological signs .
The MRI scan on admission revealed an impending cord compression at the level of T10 .
She was started on Decadron and on 1/17 began the first of ten radiation treatments to two fields ( T2 to T5 and T9 to T11 ) .
Per the patient &apos;s wishes , Dr. Dalywoo Droreite the Windgo Hospital was consulted for a second opinion regarding the management of her malignancy .
Dr. Linke recommended chemotherapy with PFL .
Per the patient &apos;s wishes , she was transferred to the Windgo Hospital for chemotherapy .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS :
INTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY AT 23 WEEKS .
HYPERCALCEMIA .
INFERIOR VENA CAVA OBSTRUCTION .
IMPENDING SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION .
IDENTIFICATION DATA :
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a 22 week intrauterine pregnancy who was transferred from Bri Health with diffuse metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was in her usual state of excellent health until July of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
Subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
On 12/23 , she was seen by Dr. Stonge at Bri Health where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
A fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
Subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
On 1/5 , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at Bri Health under local anesthesia .
The pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .
This prompted further staging work-up .
The patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at Bri Health which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
There was no obvious GIor pancreatic tumor identified .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
A specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .
The patient was transferred to Nimaconwood Valley Hospital for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .
Over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .
She has had no motor weakness , abnormal sensation , numbness , tingling or incontinence of bowel or bladder .

PTT was 29.8 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on 1/13/91 .
The work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
A bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .
Ahead CT scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the right vertex of the calvarium but no intracranial abnormalities .
Work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .

The patient was then switched to po etidronate .
IVC obstruction :
The patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by CT scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic IVC .
This has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .
The patient &apos;s low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .
Hypoxia and shortness of breath :
Although the patient &apos;s room air saturation was 96% during this admission , she subjectively complained of increased shortness of breath .
It was felt that the patient &apos;s extensive pulmonary metastases and bilateral pleural effusions resulted in increased work of respiration and a sensation of shortness of breath .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE .
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
1. METASTATIC PROSTATE CA .
2. OBSTRUCTIVE UROPATHY , STATUS POST LEFT NEPHROSTOMY .
3. HYPERTENSION .
4. ANEMIA .
5. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE .
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
This 88-year-old male with history of prostate CA was admitted from an outside hospital secondary to persistent hematuria status post nephrostomy tube placement transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further management .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Prehekote is an 88-year-old Portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 .
He received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention .
After that , he was on Lupron and Nilandron hormone therapy .
The patient was admitted on February 23 , 1999 to Eifro Medical Center because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit .
He was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine .
BUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .
Prostate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .
Further evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .
Because of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on February 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .
However after the procedure , the patient &apos;s hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .
His hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .
He also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .
Due to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from Eifro Medical Center to the Retelk County Medical Center for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries .
The patient was transferred to Genearocktemp Ry Health on March 3 , 1999 .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The patient had constipation with dysuria , but no fever or chills .
No cough .
No chest pain .
No palpitations , history of epigastric pain and body weight loss .
No headache .
No bone pain .

The patient has been living in the Kansas for more than 20 years .
He was originally from Wark and he speaks Portuguese only .
He is now living with his son and daughter , and five other children .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , the patient was a frail looking elderly male lying in bed in no acute distress .

Supple .
Jugular vein not engorged .
Carotid pulses bounding very strongly .
No thyromegaly .
Chest examination showed some basilar crackles at the right lung base .
Heart initially tachycardia , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border .
Abdomen :
Soft .
Liver and spleen were not palpable .
Bowel sounds normoactive .
Extremities :
Traced pitting edema .
No cyanosis and no clubbing .
Peripheral pulses were very strong and bounding .
No calf tenderness .
Homan &apos;s sign negative .
Neurologic :
Examination was limited because the patient speaks only Portuguese .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the patient &apos;s biochemistry showed sodium of 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 107 , bicarb 14 , BUN 63 , creatinine 5.8 , blood sugar 133 .
Liver function test showed AST 21 , alkaline phosphatase 70 , total bilirubin 0.3 , total protein 6.5 , albumin 3.9 , globulin 2.6 .
CBC :
WBC 8.4 , hematocrit 32.6 , platelet count 194,000 .
PT 11.9 , INR 1.0 , PTT 28.4 .
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiomegaly .
No lung infiltrate .
CT scan of the renal area showed right hydronephrosis which extends to an asymmetrically thickened urinary bladder wall .
A mass like thickening of the urinary bladder suggestive of either detrusor hypertrophy or possibly tumor .
The CT scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the right lower lobe compatible with metastatic or septic embolus .
EKG showed atrial fibrillation , left axis deviation , LVH , nonspecific ST-T changes either due to digitalis affect .
CK enzymes 146 .
Repeated three times and remained flat .
Troponin I on the second day of admission was 1.18 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient .
The specialist concluded that because the patient &apos;s hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient &apos;s kidney .
Urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve .
After admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis .
He was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .
After transfusion , the patient &apos;s hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .
The patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .
He continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .
During this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .
CPK was tracked , but was totally normal .
No beta blockers were given .
A long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .
Dr. Lucreamull discussed the patient &apos;s clinical status and overall situation with the patient &apos;s family and the family decided that Mr. Prehekote could return home with hospice .
The patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles will manage the hospice issues .
The patient was discharged to home for hospice on March 8 , 1999 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was referred from an outside hospital with a chief complaint of increasing shortness of breath and tires easily with exertion .
Admitted to Bay State Medical Center Hospital in 2012-10-22 in congestive heart failure at that time .
Via echocardiogram , found to have aortic stenosis .
Referred to Memorial Hospital ( Worcester ) for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate her aortic stenosis .
Cardiac catheterization done on 01-07 showed an aortic valve area of .38 cm.sq. , with a mean gradient of 62 , and a peak gradient of 85 .
Moderate pulmonary hypertension , PA pressure 48/24 , 1+ mitral regurgitation , severe aortic stenosis with an LVEDP of 19 and an ejection fraction of 43% .
She was then referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery for aortic valve replacement .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was a direct admission to the operating room on 02-12 , at which time she underwent an
aortic valve replacement .
Please see the operative report for full details .
In summary , she had an aortic valve replacement with a #21 mosaic porcine valve .
She tolerated the operation well , and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit .
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period , however , her blood pressure remained somewhat labile .
Therefore , she was continued on a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 110 .
In addition , she was slow to awaken after her anesthesia was reversed , and in several attempts to wean from the ventilator , she developed a respiratory acidosis .
She therefore remained on the ventilator throughout the day of postoperative day one .
On postoperative day two , the patient remained hemodynamically stable .
Her Neo-Synephrine drip was weaned to off .
She was again weaned from the ventilator , and successfully extubated .
Her chest tubes were discontinued and , at the end of the day , she was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation .
After being transferred to the floor , the patient did well .
Over the next several days , her activity level was increased with the assistance of Physical Therapy and the nursing staff .
She remained hemodynamically stable .
Her respiratory condition remained stable and , on postoperative day four , she was deemed stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and physical therapy .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : 
Atrial fibrillation . 
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS : 
History of multinodular goiter ; history of hypertension ; history of subtotal thyroidectomy . 
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 
Electrical cardioversion . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
Ms. Lenkpruskihkooglekih is a 63-year-old lady with a history of frequent premature ventricular contractions and infrequent short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ( one four-beat run ) in 1991 , for which several antiarrhythmic agents including Propranolol , Quinidine , Procainamide , Tenormin , Norpace , Corgard , and Flecainide were used , but were stopped because of intolerance . 
At that time , she had clear coronary arteries on coronary angiography and an ejection fraction greater than 50% . 
She did well off antiarrhythmic agents until October of this year when she was noted to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate after several days of decreased exercise tolerance . 
She was started on Coumadin and had a failed attempt at DC electrical cardioversion on 11/16/96 . 
She has been on Coumadin since and has continued to have occasional palpitations and mild shortness of breath . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : 
Includes a history of hypertension ; multinodular goiter ; subtotal thyroidectomy .

There were diffuse ST segment and T-wave abnormalities , which were nonspecific . 
A complete blood count , electrolytes , BUN and creatinine were within normal limits . 
INR was elevated at 2.5 . 
An echocardiogram was performed , which showed completely normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction calculated at .74 . 
There was no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or asymmetric septal hypertrophy , which had been an issue that had been raised on an echocardiogram in Ownra Cin , New Mexico on 12/06/96 . 
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT : 
The patient was started on Propafenone 300 mg three times a day and underwent an attempt at electrical cardioversion after seven doses of this . 
This failed , despite one shock at 300 joules and two shocks at 360 joules . 
The Propafenone was stopped , and the patient was changed to Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. , which was continued for two days . 
The patient was discharged to home on Amiodarone 200 mg daily on 12/29/96 . 
An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of QT prolongation prior to discharge , and pulmonary function tests will be performed before the patient goes home today . 
The patient will follow up with Dr. Ther Ludzjesc at Shiekeu Hospital Medical Centers in Connecticut .

CARDIOTHOR
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52 year old Czech speaking gentleman with a history of severe mitral regurgitation .
For the past several years , the patient has continued to have significant exercise intolerance which has limited his ability to work .
He reports severe dyspnea on exertion .
The patient had a recent admission earlier in the month and he was discharged on 2015-09-10 , after undergoing cardiac catheterization .
This was significant for demonstrating no flow-limited disease in the coronaries but several fistulae
from the left anterior descending to the PA .
Several of these were coil embolized during this admission .
He tolerated this well , was sent home , and now returns for his mitral valve repair .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On the day of admission , the patient went to the Operating Room and underwent a minimally invasive
mitral valve repair .
He tolerated this procedure well .
The patient was brought to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on minimal pressor support .
He was successfully weaned off this support .
The patient was fully weaned from ventilatory support secondary to a persistent acidemia .
This was treated with sodium bicarbonate and a Swan-Ganz was placed to provide close hemodynamic monitoring .
The patient was found to have stable hemodynamics with appropriate mixed venous saturations in the 70% range .
The patient was corrected to a normal pH of 7.41 by the first postoperative night and remained stable .
He was then weaned off of ventilatory support and was successfully extubated .
The patient did have a slight bit of confusion early in post-extubation course which cleared .
This was also compounded by a language barrier since the patient cannot speak English .
In addition , the patient 's early postoperative course had a tremendous urine output .
It was equally up to 700 cc. an hour and a renal consultation was obtained .
He underwent a head CT scan to rule out intracranial pathology leading to diabetes insipidus .
This was negative .
The patient 's serum and urine electrolytes indicated that this diuresis was appropriate .
The patient 's urine output has decreased and his BUN and creatinine remained normal .
The patient 's Foley was discontinued .
He had developed some hematuria which has resolved .
The patient has remained stable and is now ready for discharge to home with follow-up in approximately four weeks .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
POST LAMINECTOMY SYNDROME , STATUS POST FAILED TRIAL OF INTRATHECAL OPIOID PUMP .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is a AGE[in 40s]- year-old female with signs and symptoms of post laminectomy syndrome .
It was felt that a trial of an implanted intrathecal opioid pump might be of benefit to the patient .
She entered the hospital and began a trial of a morphine pump on DATE[Aug 29 07] .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient remained alert and oriented , afebrile with stable vitals during her stay .
However , she experienced significant nausea and vomiting with very little relief in her pre-existing pain during the morphine trial .
As a result , the intrathecal medication was changed from morphine to Dilaudid .
By postop day number 2 , her nausea had cleared and she was tolerating p.o. intake .
However , despite large increases in the intrathecal administration rate , she received essentially no relief of her pretrial pain .
She also complained of a severe positional headache on postop day number 1 .
This was treated with IV fluids and flat bed rest , and it resolved on its own prior to discharge .
The patient 's insertion site was clean , dry and intact .
Her motor exam and sensation to light touch appear to remain intact throughout her stay .
The patient noted that she had been prescribed fentanyl patches in the past .
However , she had syncopal episodes and apparent convulsions while using these .
As a result , this medication could not be considered as an option when the patient was not receiving adequate relief from the Dilaudid trial .
Finally , on postop day number 3 , secondary to failure of pain relief using either morphine or Dilaudid , and because of an inability to use fentanyl secondary to prior historical problems with that medication , it was elected to end the trial .
The catheter was pulled without complications , and the catheter insertion site was closed with a single pursestring stitch .
The patient was medically safe for discharge home on postop day number 3 .

HISTORY :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]-year-old pleasant man who was discharged recently to **INSTITUTION Rehab after a long admission for throat , renal failure , sepsis , and severe pneumonia .
He was doing well at the rehab ; however , on the night before the day of admission , he started to have diarrhea .
He did not respond to treatment .
C. diff toxin was sent , but the patient became hypotensive , his creatinine went up to 2 and BUN became elevated .
He became tachycardic , and showing irregular heart beats .
For all these reasons , he was transferred to **INSTITUTION for further management and evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with initial problems that included severe diarrhea confirmed later to be from C. diff colitis , it was treated with Flagyl and Lactinex and seemed to improve slowly .
His other issue was hypotension and tachycardia related to dehydration and low volume .
It was corrected with IV fluids .
He had renal failure on admission , the creatinine was 2.0 and elevated BUN .
That seemed to correct with IV fluids , creatinine improved down to 1.2 .
He was tachycardic and showing irregular heart beats on admission , that seemed to improve to normal sinus rhythm with controlled rate at the time of discharge .
The patient had swelling in the right arm , there was question of DVT .
However , venous Dopplers came back negative .
I would still watch that closely , consider further evaluation if the swelling continues .
The patient continues to have the problem with dysphagia .
He is on dysphagia diet .
However , his main complaint and problem seem to be persistent congestion in the lungs and sputum production and cough .
He had recent pneumonia which seemed to be getting better on CT scan and chest x-ray .
I wonder if he has either components of microaspiration or postnasal drip which could be contributing .
Appropriate treatments are being given to that .
Other agents could be added later in the future .
As the patient seemed to improve from the diarrhea standpoint and as his kidney function coming back to normal , his blood pressure and heart rate are improving , we felt that he could go back to the **INSTITUTION Rehab to continue physical therapy and rehabilitation .
He will continue his medications .
He needs to follow up with his right arm swelling and his lung status .
LABORATORY DATA :
Prior to discharge , his stool for occult blood was negative .
His sodium was 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 119 , BUN 17 , creatinine 1.4 , calcium 8.2. His INR was 21 , TIBC 1 was 7 and iron saturation was 20% , ferritin 251 .
Hemoglobin was 9.0 , hematocrit 26.8 , and platelet count 255 .
DISPOSITION :
**INSTITUTION Rehab in stable condition .
Continue to follow at that institution .

CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS , NOW RESOLVED .
Briefly , this is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female with a past medical history significant for diabetes , hypertension , atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , and hypothyroidism .
She was at home when she was preparing for breakfast and complained of sudden onset of weakness , no chest pain , no shortness of breath , no nausea or vomiting .
She subsequently sustained a fall , did not loss consciousness , did not hit her head , but she did called her daughter to assist her via the telephone .
The patient 's daughter noted that the patient was confused and when the Medics assessed her , on the scene , they found her capillary blood sugar to be 65 .
She was immediately improved , in terms of her mental status , after D50 infusion .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .

She lives alone .
No alcohol or tobacco .
MEDICATIONS OF DISCHARGE INCLUDE :
1. Verapamil 240 mg once daily .
2. Fosamax 70 mg once weekly .

12. She will hold her previously prescribed Glipizide of 10 mg b.i.d.
All her medications will be the same except for Glipizide .
On discharge , her mental status has improved .
Her pulse is in the low 100 s ; blood pressure 145/70 , saturations 96% on 2 L nasal cannula and 92% on room air .
She is afebrile her vital signs are stable .
EKG notable to be in her known atrial fibrillation .
Chest x-ray on admission had some mild interstitial edema and she was treated with Lasix with which she diuresed well and is now clinically hemodynamically stable .
Her mental status has improved and was likely caused by her hypoglycemia , therefore , we will hold her Glipizide .
She will continue with her Synthroid medication and cardiovascularly and hemodynamically she is stable .
She previously had symptomatic bradycardia on a previous hospitalization and followup visit with her Cardiologist Dr. **NAME[TTT] and she has since been discontinued on digoxin , it was unlikely that she had any symptomatic bradycardic during this acute episode and was unlikely the cause of her change in mental status and fall .

REASON FOR ADMISSION :
**NAME[BBB AAA] is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female who presented to Northwest with some episodes of confusion .

In the interim , the patient was discharged to home and had worsening episodes of confusion and left - sided weakness for which she was readmitted to **INSTITUTION .
At that time , her previously noted right posterior splenial lesion was noted to have intralesional hemorrhage .
At this point , she was urgently transported down to **INSTITUTION for further evaluation .
CT scan at this point showed a stable area of blood .
The patient was able to be transferred out of the ICU without difficulty .
She underwent MR - guided stereotactic biopsy on **DATE[May 16 2007] without difficulty .
The preliminary pathology at this time was GBM .
On **DATE[May 18 2007] , we expect she will be transferred back to Northwest for skilled nursing facility / TCU care .

Consult during this stay was Cardiology for her new-onset SVT .
Echocardiogram was done during this stay , and similar echocardiogram was done during a stress test showing normal left ventricular size , normal valvular structure , and ejection fraction of 55% to 60% , normal right ventricular wall thickness , and normal pulmonary artery pressures , but a questionable posterior wall defect in the left circumflex distribution .
A cardiac catheterization was performed due to this defect by Cardiology , and the catheterization showed right dominant , left main clear , left anterior descending clear , left circumflex clear , and right circumflex clear .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient presented with noticing palpitations while in the office .
EKG demonstrated SVT .
A V / Q scan was done which was negative .
She had a borderline elevation of her D - dimer .
She was then admitted to the hospital due to the SVT , placed on the monitor , given diltiazem .
Diltiazem rapidly controlled her rate .
The V / Q scan was done because of the positive D - dimer that was negative .
Chest x-ray demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions .
Cardiology was involved .
The stress test was done as noted above .
Catheterization was done as noted above .
The patient tolerated the medications and discharged to home .

ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 08 2007]
DISCHARGE DATE :
**DATE[Mar 15 2007]
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This patient has had a history of atrial fibrillation which was initially diagnosed in 2001 .
He has undergone previous DC cardioversions and has been managed in the past on flecainide , digoxin , and Rythmol .
After his cardioversion in **DATE[Sep 2006] , he reverted back to atrial fibrillation and flecainide was restarted .
He remained on flecainide and digoxin up until this hospitalization because of his recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation .
When in this arrhythmia , he feels warm and clammy , sometimes diaphoretic , shortness of breath , and palpitations .
He admits to times of felling near syncopal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient initially was admitted to the Cath Lab holding area .
He was then underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram .
This showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% to 65% , a nondilated left ventricle , and no clots or spontaneous contrast in the left atrial appendage .
A CT scan of the chest at that time as well showed normal pulmonary vein anatomy , moderately elevated calcium scores , and moderate atherosclerosis with CAD with a long noncalcified plaque proximal to mid LAD causing mild - to - moderate narrowing .
A large calcified plaque was identified in the mid LAD .
The following day he underwent a radiofrequency catheter ablation of posterior left atrium for his atrial fibrillation .
The procedure without incident , and the specifics are well documented in the operative note , which will be provided under separate cover .
His postextubation period was evident for thick brown sputum with some moderate decrease in his O2 saturations .
His chest x-ray at that time showed that the right lung was diffusely hazy .
We suspected aspiration or a chemical pneumonitis .
At that point , he was given incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet .
No antibiotics were started .
A noncontrast CT of the chest was done the day after , which showed patchy consolidation in all lobes of both lungs , which apparently was consistent with aspiration .
There was no evidence for pulmonary edema; however , the CT scan identified small bilateral pleural effusions and coronary calcifications .
Based on the results of both the CT scans , we discontinued his flecainide in the light of possible coronary artery disease .
We felt that he likely had chemical pneumonitis as the result of the general anesthesia , intubation , and ablation procedure .
After reviewing the results of the CT scans , the following day he underwent an adenosine - thallium stress test .
This test documented a left ventricular ejection fraction of 61% ; normal left ventricular wall motion ; no significant associated ST segment abnormalities ; no arrhythmias ; and no significant ischemia .
His postprocedural transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence for a pericardial effusion .
He remained in a normal sinus rhythm throughout his hospital stay off flecainide and Lanoxin and remained in the hospital until his INR was therapeutic .
He was discharged to home on **DATE[Mar 15 2007] , with an INR of 2.0 .
He was seen by Dr. **NAME[VVV] prior to his discharge who knows he had not been on Coumadin for about 10 years .
We sent him home with Coumadin 10 mg alternating with 15 mg of Coumadin as well as Ecotrin 325 mg .
LABORATORY DATA :
His lab work at discharge showed hematocrit of 31.4 , hemoglobin of 11.3 , WBC s 5.6 , and platelets were 256 .
His INR 2.0 on **DATE[Mar 15 2007] , and 1.4 on **DATE[Mar 14 2007] .
He will obtain a prothrombin time with INR 3 days after his hospital discharge .
The patient requested that Dr. **NAME[UUU TTT] , his primary care physician , manage his Coumadin therapy .
FOLLOWUP :
He will follow with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] at the **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Apr 23 2007] .
He will follow with his primary care physician on **DATE[Mar 16 2007] , and he will follow as well with Dr. **NAME[SSS RRR] , his cardiologist , in 4 weeks .

TRANSFERRED TO CARE OF :
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension who presented to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Jul 4 2007] , with complaints of a 40 - pound weight gain and increased peripheral edema .
At **INSTITUTION , she was found to be heart failure with severe mitral regurgitation and there was a question of possible vegetation seen on her mitral valve on TTE .
She also had developed a right leg ulcer which became open and was concerning for a possible infection for which they treated with Augmentin .
Due to the patient 's question of possible mitral valve seen on a TTE , she was then transferred to **INSTITUTION for further management on **DATE[Jul 7 2007] .
Past medical history :
1. Hypertension .
2. Four - vessel CABG .
3. Hyperlipidemia .
4. Hypothyroidism .
5. Diabetes .
6. History of heart failure .
Echocardiogram done in 1998 showed an EF of 30% .
The following echocardiogram done on **DATE[Jul 15 2004] , showed an EF of 65% .
7. History of peptic ulcer disease with a GI bleed in **DATE[Sep] of 2004 .
8. History of dementia .
9. History of osteoarthritis .
10. Status post cholecystectomy .
11. Status post hysterectomy .
Hospital course :
1. Heart failure .
The patient was re - evaluated with a TTE here at **INSTITUTION which showed LVH , EF of 55 to 60% with severe RV dysfunction .
She was also noted to have a thickened and restricted aortic valve , severe mitral regurgitation , severe tricuspid regurgitation , and a PA pressure of 56 mmHg .
She was then evaluated by cardiac surgery for possible mitral valve and tricuspid valve replacement .
However , a Euro risk score was calculated at 40% of perioperative mortality for Ms. **NAME[AAA] and she was deemed too medically unstable for surgery .
We initially attempted to diurese by using IV Lasix and she was started on milrinone to attempt to increase her cardiac output .
However , despite being on milrinone and IV Lasix , she continued to have very poor diuresis and she developed worsening acute renal failure .
Given her poor heart function , she was discontinued off the milrinone and IV Lasix and started on hemodialysis .
She was also discontinued off her home Diovan due to her acute renal failure .
The patient was later started on a heart failure regimen of hydralazine and isosorbide .
A repeat right heart catheterization on **DATE[Jul 18 2007] , showed no improvement of her PA pressures despite aggressive diuresis with hemodialysis .
Therefore , she remained an extremely poor surgical candidate and will only be medically managed .
We will continue her on aspirin , Lipitor , isosorbide , and hydralazine .
When she is more stable , we may consider starting an ACE inhibitor as an outpatient .
2. Renal .
The patient , upon admission to **INSTITUTION , had acute renal failure with creatinine of 2 .
Her renal function continued to worsen due to her poor cardiac output and she did require hemodialysis .
A tunneled dialysis catheter was inserted , and she will likely be maintained on hemodialysis indefinitely .
The patient was also started on Aranesp and IV iron for chronic anemia .
She will have outpatient hemodialysis every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday .
3. Diabetes .
The patient was discontinued off her home metformin and was started on glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q. day .
Her glucose control was good throughout her hospitalization and she will be continued on glipizide as well as sliding scale insulin .
4. Hypothyroidism .
The patient will continue on Synthroid 300 micrograms p.o. q. day .
5. Wound care .
The patient had developed a blister on her right lower extremity due to her significant edema which then progressed to an ulcer .
She had been treated as an outpatient with Augmentin .
The wound was initially 11 x 10 cm in area ; however , it did not appear infection and antibiotics were discontinued .
She was continued on wound care , and upon discharge , her lower extremity ulcer had significantly improved to a size of 1 cm in diameter .
We will continue wound care for her right lower extremity wound as well as her coccyx sacral wound as an outpatient .
6. ID .
The patient was initially transferred to **INSTITUTION with concerns about possible vegetation in her mitral valve .
However , repeat TEE on **DATE[Jul 8 2007] , as well as **DATE[Jul 18 2007] , showed no signs of vegetation or thrombus .
She was discontinued off antibiotics upon admission and cultures have remained negative .
She has also remained afebrile throughout her hospitalization at **INSTITUTION .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is to be transferred to **INSTITUTION for nursing home care .
TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS :
1. Wound care of coccyx sacral wound .
Please apply 4 x 4 DuoDERM and change every 4 days .

The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]- year-old white female with a history of subendocardial MI in the past , but catheterization x 3 has been without significant disease .
She has a long history of reflux esophagitis , and she is now admitted with burning chest pain and pressure yesterday after breakfast .
She also felt somewhat dyspneic and noted some burping and distention .
In the ER , her EKG showed no change and her troponins were okay .
Examination initially was unremarkable , except for epigastric discomfort on palpation .
Consultation was obtained with Cardiology .
They agreed she needed a stress test .
She underwent a stress test which was somewhat abnormal , and she therefore was sent to the catheterization lab .
Remarkably , her catheterization showed no significant coronary stenosis .
It was therefore felt that her symptoms were secondary to GERD , and she was allowed to be discharged home on a proton pump inhibitor .
Please see medication list for all of her heart medications , thyroid dosage , and blood pressure pills .

Through the evening of **DATE[Apr 31 2007] , and into the wee hours of the morning on **DATE[May 1 2007] , the patient ran fevers .
Blood cultures and urine cultures were obtained .
The patient 's white count , the day after the procedure had increased from 7 to 17 , and we opted to keep the patient on IV antibiotics for another day .
Through the day of **DATE[May 1 2007] , the patient remained afebrile ; however , around midnight on **DATE[Apr 2 2007] , again , he was febrile .
His white count , however , on **DATE[May 2 2007] , had come down to 12 .
The patient did develop a rash over his chest , back , and upper arms , the morning of **DATE[May 2 2007] .
Both the patient and the spouse report that the patient experiences rashes like these around once every 6 weeks .
Workup for this rash so far has been inconclusive .
We stopped the patient 's cephalosporin .
We gave the patient 50 mg of IV Benadryl with resolution of his rash .
Regarding the function of the patient 's biventricular defibrillator , we noted , the day after procedure , that there were times when the patient was in the biventricular pacing .
Interrogation , the day after the procedure revealed an LV pacing threshold of 5 V at 0.5 msec and 3 to 3.5 V at 1 msec .
We retested the patient 's pacing threshold in the LV lead twice on **DATE[May 1 2007] , and again got a second pacing threshold measurement of 3 V at 1.0 msec .
We opted to reprogram the outputs on the left ventricular lead to 4 V at 1.0 msec .
Initially , the patient did complain of some diaphragmatic stimulation ; however , this was quite short-lived .
On the morning of discharge , the patient reported no recent ventricular stimulation and hence we kept the patient 's output on LV lead programmed at 4 V at 1 msec .
On the day of discharge , the patient 's lungs are clear .
The left subclavian ICD incision is well approximated , and the Steri-Strips are intact .
There was some mild ecchymoses at the site but no induration and no hematoma formation .
The patient also has ecchymoses at both groins , again , no hematoma formation and he is ambulating without pain and he is able to weightbear .
We are opting to discharge the patient to home today .
He will be seen in followup on **DATE[May 15 2007] , and we have advised the patient to report any new rashes to the office since we will be sending him home on an oral antibiotic .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Metastatic ocular melanoma .
2. Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia .
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation .
**INSTITUTION COURSE :
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year-old female with a history of metastatic ocular melanoma , status post enucleation of the right eye performed in 1994 .
The patient has undergone multiple different chemotherapeutic regimens , as well as Interferon and Interleukin-2 in the past , and was most recently enrolled in a new UPCI protocol .
The patient has known worsening metastatic disease in the lung , liver , soft tissues as well as spine , and is also known to have significant compression of the common bile duct .
The patient did have to discontinue her most recent UPCI experimental protocol secondary to worsening liver function tests as well as diarrhea .
The patient presented today to **NAME[VVV] for routine follow up , and at that time had some basic labs drawn which revealed a creatinine of 1.8 and a potassium level of 6.4 .
The patient was subsequently admitted for management of her hyperkalemia .
1. With regards to the patient 's metabolic abnormalities including her elevated creatinine and hyperkalemia , the patient did receive multiple doses of Kayexalate , and did also receive 1 gram of calcium gluconate as well .
The patient did not have any EKG changes consistent with hyperkalemia .
We did hydrate the patient with IV fluids , and we did discontinue the potassium supplements that the patient had been receiving as an outpatient .
With these therapies , we did discontinue her potassium level down to within the normal range by the time of discharge .
2. With regards to the patient 's thrombocytopenia , we did check a DIC panel which was positive , demonstrating a low fibrinogen , positive D-dimer , and positive fibrin degradation products .
The patient , in addition , also had a mildly elevated INR of 1.5 .
We did give the patient some FFP , but given her very poor prognosis at this point , we did not further aggressively manage the DIC .
3. With regards to the patient 's metastatic ocular melanoma , we did discuss the patient 's perception of her current treatment options .
She did express understanding of the fact that there was not much more to be done in terms of treatment for her disease , and she did express a desire in terms of talking with the palliative care service here .
We subsequently did consult the palliative care service to discuss options of palliative care versus home hospice with the patient .
After discussing these issues with the patient , she did decide to become comfort measures only and to be discharged to home with home hospice .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Phos-Lo 1334 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals .
2. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. OxyContin 20 mg p.o. q. 12 hours .

**INSTITUTION :
This remarkable **AGE[90+]- year-old widow , who lives with her niece and son-in-law on a farm , had a syncopal episode .
She does not remember going down .
She sustained a left lower spiral tibial fracture and a fibular fracture .
She was brought to the emergency room .
Her past medical history is significant for triple-vessel disease in the coronaries evaluated in the past by Dr. **NAME[WWW] .
The patient is no candidate for [_______________]*** procedure and she has also had a bitemporal severe arteritis approximately 4 years ago that responded slow taper of steroids .
I have not seen her for several months , but she has continued to receive 10 mg of prednisone on a daily basis without incident .
She has had a CVA in the past with diplopia , but no recurrence .
She has had a right mastectomy for many many years ago without any recurrence and suffers from osteoporosis .
Her blood pressure was stable .
On exam she was 130/80 and a pulse of 76 with rare ectopics .
There was some mild skin ecchymosis in the upper extremities .
There was some flat skin lesions over the scalp .
The patient was alert and had a fairly good memory .
The heart was significant for a grade 2 to 3 over 6 systolic murmur at the base that radiated into the neck and into the left as well as the right carotid areas .
The lungs were clear .
The patient was in a wheelchair .
The extremities showed a left leg cast just below the knee .
Her current medications when she came in was
1. Norvasc .
2. Plavix .
3. Prednisone .
4. Metoprolol .
The patient was seen by cardiology as well as by orthopedics .
The patient received some physical therapy , but continued to have problems with significant pain .
Relief of pain was difficult and ultimately required OxyContin Extended Release .
This was at first 10 mg twice a day then increased to 20 b.i.d. and finally 30 mg twice a day .
She had a problem with constipation and urinary retention , but this was relieved by disimpaction and with a soapsuds enema .
Her last set of chemistries looked fairly stable .
She did show some very mild iron deficiency with 10% saturation and her B12 level was also low when she was seen .
Orthopedics followed her and felt that nonweightbearing for 6 to 8 weeks with a walker and then functional brace and will take approximately 3 months to heal and then of course the patient will need to be followed up by Dr. **NAME[XXX] at all .
The TIBC was 277 and her iron saturation at 10% .
Her TSH was upper limits of normal at 4.92 .
A B12 level was 190 and a folic acid was normal at 6.7 .
Other studies appeared quite good .
She was seen in consultation by Dr. **NAME[VVV] who felt the patient was reasonably stable at this point ; however , she did evolve with some chest pain 24 hours prior to discharge and had a slight elevation of the troponin consistent with probably a remote myocardial infarction .
The patient was discharged definitely improved for rehab at Vincentian Regency under the care of Dr. **NAME[UUU] .
It is conceivably possible that the patient begins to ambulate and she may return home with her niece and son-in-law .

ADDENDUM :
I discussed with both the sisters **NAME[RRR] and **NAME[QQQ] , and I had discussed with them extensively regarding how sick the patient was and how emergent that she needs to be intubated .
But both the sisters had discussed among themselves , and they had expressed their wish that they do not want their mother to be intubated or to be on ventilation , but however , they agreed for all the other intervention other than do not intubate and not put her on ventilation .
The patient is struggling to breathe at this time , and she is tachypneic , and she might have to be intubated right now but ; however , the patient 's family did not wish the patient to be intubated even after I explained to them that she could potentially die if she was not on a breathing machine ; but however , the patient 's family stressed to me again and wished that they do not want her mother to be on a breathing machine .
They do not want her to be intubated even though it is only a temporary measure where she does not have to be on the breathing machine for long .
It would be only a temporary measure until she can maintain her airway and then they can extubate her .
I explained to her that it is only going to be a short - term temporary measure , and after her pneumonia gets better , she could probably be extubated but even then , she did not wish her mother to be intubated .

**INSTITUTION COURSE :
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old female who initially was admitted as a transfer from **INSTITUTION for evaluation of changed mental status and because she is a patient of **INSTITUTION and she has always been taken care of in **INSTITUTION .
At admission , the patient was disoriented and had mental status changes and is a poor historian .
According to her live-in caregiver , the patient has reportedly become more confused during the two days prior to this admission .
The caregiver denied the patient has a fever , sweats , or chills .
The caregiver noticed that the patient has had frequent urination during the past couple of days .
**INSTITUTION , a CT had been performed and a urinalysis and a culture also has been sent out .
From the urinalysis , she was gram-positive cocci .
That CT scan shows no acute intracranial hemorrhage .
The patient had been given Cipro for her UTI and also the patient was given Pepcid for some other GI symptoms .
Upon the patient 's transfer to **INSTITUTION , her mental status is getting worse .
She has more confusion and also developed some delirium and hallucinations .
Upon review of her medications , we took her off Cipro and Pepcid and put her on Macrobid for her UTI .
We also found that her eyes were red and dry and have fluent discharge and so the eye purulent discharge has been sent for culture and also urine has been sent in for culture again and when the results came back the patient was found to have MRSA in her eye discharge and also has a MRSA infection in her urine , 100,000 colonies in the culture .
The patient has been maintained with no fever and no white count elevation .
Dr. **NAME[RRR] has been consulted for ID issues and urosepsis is likely .
We changed the patient 's vancomycin IV to Bactrim DS b.i.d. and also gave gentamicin for her conjunctivitis .
In the meanwhile , we will get a history from her caregiver .
The patient had eyelid and eye tear duct surgery done before in **INSTITUTION .
An ophthalmologist has been consulted .
Polysporin was given for her eye instead of gentamicin per the ophthalmologist .
For the patient 's mental status , we are treating her infection .
Meanwhile , we consulted Psychiatry and a neurologist .
Neurology reviewed her CT scan and assessment after review of her CT scan was no further imaging necessary per the neurologist .
The psychiatry consultant recommended the patient has baseline dementia and basically to treat the infection and correct her dehydration and electrolyte imbalance .
We also questioned her power of attorney regarding alcohol abuse .
According to her caregiver , she is not a heavy drinker , only an occasional social drinker .

The B12 is 257 , which is within normal range .
With rehydration and treating her infections in the urine tract and in her eye , Mrs. **NAME[AAA] 's mental status is getting better with treating her infections and correcting her dehydration and electrolyte imbalance .
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] has been hyponatremic after we corrected those imbalanced electrolytes and her mental status is dramatically improving .
During this admission , the patient has also complained of right shoulder pain .
We also consulted Orthopedic Surgery and an x-ray has been performed of her right shoulder , elbow , and wrist and the findings are she has pseudogout in her right arm and a cock-up splint is being placed on the patient 's right wrist by orthopedics and also Celebrex has been prescribed to give to the patient but the patient 's renal function is getting worse after taking the Celebrex so these medications are being held and never been given back .
Today , the patient has no complaint of a headache , shortness of breath , or chest pain .
She is afebrile and vital signs are stable at this moment .

Mr. **NAME[AAA] was diagnosed with bladder cancer in **DATE[Jul 2007] .
He , initially , presented for evaluation of severe flank pain .
He was found to have a ureteral obstruction and a nephrostomy tube was placed .
He underwent a TURBT , establishing the diagnosis of bladder cancer .

Approximately , 1 week later the patient noticed a tender mass in his left axilla and contacted his PCP on **DATE[Nov 10 2007] .
His PCP placed him on an unknown antibiotic to be taken 4 times a day .
After finishing the course , the patient had no improvement , returned to his PCP who put him on a different antibiotic ( also unknown ) to be taken once per day .
The patient developed weakness , fever , arthralgias , and myalgias and presented to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Nov 17 2006] .
At **INSTITUTION , the patient was began on numerous antibiotics including cefazolin on **DATE[Nov 17 2007] , doxycycline and moxifloxacin on **DATE[Nov 21 2007] , azithromycin was started on **DATE[Nov 22 2007] , and vancomycin on **DATE[Nov 23 2007] .
The patient was then transferred to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Nov 23 2007] , for further evaluation .
The patient has also complained of a dry cough that has been present since mid-December 2006 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1 Left shoulder bursitis .
2 Low back strain requiring hospitalization for pain in 2002 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On admission , the patient was found to have a mild fever , myalgias , and arthralgias that were relieved by Tylenol .
On physical examination , the patient had 2 healing papules on the dorsum of his left thumb and a tender 3-cm nodule in his left axilla .
The patient had mildly elevated liver enzymes .
His elevated liver enzymes are believed to be related to the patient 's consuming 12 to 15 Tylenol per day for 3 weeks .
Acetaminophen was therefore discontinued , and his LFTs improved .
The patient has a pet cat .
He is a hunter with a known history of exposure to deer and raccoon hides , Bartonella , and tularemia were higher in differential .
The patient was initially placed on azithromycin to cover Bartonella and gentamicin to cover tularemia .
Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended doxycycline to cover both organisms .
CT scan revealed a collection of fluid around an enlarged left axillary lymph node .
The collection was incised and drained by General Surgery and specimen sent to Microbiology for bacterial and fungal cultures , results which are pending .
The patient improved clinically following the procedure .
Given the patient 's clinical improvement on doxycycline and status post I and D , the patient was discharged home to follow up with his PCP in 4 days .
At discharge , all cultures were negative .
The patient was advised to follow up on the laboratory results from **INSTITUTION and **INSTITUTION .
Pending labs included wound , bacterial , and fungal cultures and serologies for Bartonella , Francisella , Yersinia , EBV ,
CMV , and Brucella .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. for 4 weeks .
The patient was therefore sent home on oral doxycycline and was given instructions to wear wide - brimmed cap when in the sun and to wear SPF-30 sunscreen on all exposed skin surfaces .
The patient is also instructed to take the medication with food for proper absorption .
The patient will follow up with his PCP Dr. **NAME[WWW XXX] on Tuesday , **DATE[Nov 30 2007] , at 10:30 a.m.
If his condition does not improve or worsens , the patient was instructed to call the **INSTITUTION .
The patient will receive home wound care and was discharged with his PICC line in place .
Also of note , the patient had prostatomegaly on CT scan .
It would be useful to follow this at outpatient if the patient is symptomatic .

CONSULTS :
GI , Dr. **NAME[VVV] .
PROCEDURES :
1. Chest x-ray done on **DATE[Sep 20 2007] , showed an extensive consolidation in the left mid lung .
Reevaluation would be appropriate after a course of antibiotics to ensure that the consolidation resolved and exclude a postobstructive pneumonia .
2. A repeat chest x-ray frontal and lateral views done on **DATE[Sep 21 2007] , still revealed extensive consolidation in the left upper lobe with air bronchograms compatible with pneumonia .
Again , a reevaluation was recommended .
3. A CT scan of the chest , and abdomen and pelvis done on **DATE[Sep 22 2007] , showed the following :
A large area of consolidation involving nearly the entire left upper lobe compatible with pneumonia .
There is also a minimal consolidation in the left lower lobe as well as a left effusion and small right effusion .
There is no discrete mass seen .
The abdomen showed a small amount of free fluid and no intra-abdominal mass .
There is a small amount of pelvic free fluid .
There is a heterogenous attenuation within the bladder , presumably representing a clot .
There is no discrete mass identified .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old African-American female with a past medical history significant only for diabetes who now presents with fever of about 1 week 's duration associated with chills , and generalized weakness , poor appetite and a dry cough ,
She reports a weight loss of about 20 pounds over the past month and some night sweats .
She has a smoking history of about 25 to 30 years of less than 1/2 pack per day .
She denies alcohol and drug use .
On examination , the patient appeared cachectic , but not in distress .
Her vital signs on admission were blood pressure of 174/100 , which later improved spontaneously to 136/76 .
She had an initial heart rate of 117 , temperature of 37.8 , O2 sat 97% at room air .
She had dry mucous membranes .
There were no lymphadenopathies noted in the neck .
Cardiovascular exam was normal .
Examination of the lungs was clear with decreased breath sounds over the left lung field .
Abdominal exam was unremarkable .
She had no edema and she had full and equal pulses .
Laboratories showed normal electrolytes .
BUN of 8 and creatinine 0.6 .
Glucose was elevated at 377 .
CBC showed the following :
Elevated WBC at 14.4 with a left shift .
Hemoglobin was 12.2 , hematocrit of 36.5 .
The patient had an albumin of 2.5 , total protein 5.1 , bilirubin 0.7 , ALT 89 , AST 164 , and alkaline phosphatase of 195 .
Initial frontal chest x-ray was read as left upper lobe pneumonia .
Urinalysis done showed ketones 3+ , blood 1+ , protein 1+ , glucose 3+ .
It was negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase .
So this patient was admitted as a case of pneumonia and was started on IV azithromycin and Rocephin .
She was given antipyretics for fever and was hydrated initially .
The following issues were addressed during her hospital stay :
1. Pneumonia :
As mentioned , the patient was given IV antibiotics .
She had a T-max of 39.1 which was treated with antipyretics .
She was also given drug aerosol treatments as needed .
By the second day , the patient remained afebrile , and was switched to p.o. antibiotics which she tolerated well .
Blood cultures showed no growth .
Legionella urine antigen was also negative .
Because of the possible postobstructive etiology in the chest for the pneumonia , chest CT scan was done which was negative for malignancy .
On discharge , the patient remained afebrile with improved WBC and stable vital signs and no O2 requirement .
The plan was for her to complete the course of oral antibiotics .
2. Dehydration :
The patient came in dehydrated and was given IV fluids for hydration and was noted to have improved p.o. intake throughout the rest of her hospital stay .
3. Diabetes mellitus :
The patient has not been on any medications .
She reports a 10 year history of diabetes .
She was initially put on metformin on admission , but this was changed to glyburide since the patient had to undergo a CT scan .
She was also put on insulin sliding scale coverage .
She also received Lantus .
Glucose had on and off control .
HbAIc showed 15.3% .
On insulin use , this was discussed with the patient .
She deferred this and opted to stay on oral medications first .
She was also started on aspirin and an ACE inhibitor for renal protection .
She was given an ADA diet during her hospital stay .
4. Low MCV anemia :
Iron studies showed an iron of 21 , TIBC of 103 , iron saturation percent of 20 .
A stool guaiac was ordered , but the patient was not able to give any specimen for this .
GI was consulted to further evaluate for possible GI blood loss ; however , GI will hold off further evaluation including endoscopy and colonoscopy until the pneumonia is cleared .
5. Elevated liver function tests :
On admission , she had elevated liver function tests .
An alcohol level was taken which did not show any evidence of alcohol .
Urine toxicology screen was only positive for marijuana .
Hepatitis panel was negative .
Lipase was normal .
She had a GGPT of 66 .
The elevated liver function may still be related to an acute infection , but because of the presentation of weight loss with anemia and sweating , an oncologic etiology was considered .
Again , GI was on board to evaluate this .
A CEA was taken which was normal .
On the third hospital day , the patient was deemed stable for discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Were the following :
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily .
2. Glyburide 10 mg p.o. with breakfast .
3. Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.

FOLLOWUP :
The patient is to follow up with Dr. **NAME[XXX] at the **INSTITUTION on Tuesday , **DATE[Sep 30 2007] .
ADDENDUM :
A lipid panel was also taken which showed triglycerides of 174 , cholesterol of 96 , LDL of 48 , HDL 13 and VLDL of 35 .
Because of the CT scan finding in the pelvis of heterogenous attenuation within the bladder which might represent a clot , a urine cytology was ordered , and is not yet available on discharge .
This should be followed after the patient is discharged .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS( ES ) :
Left ankle fracture overlying wound .
**INSTITUTION .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Good .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old male who 9 - days prior was admission was jet skating in Florida when another jet skater hit him on the outside of his left leg .
He had ankle pain , a wound over his lateral ankle and also his medial proximal tibia and went to see doctor in Florida at that time .
In Florida , he was told that he had an open - ankle fracture and that he is to be admitted to the hospital and treated .
He elected to leave the hospital and fly back to **PLACE .
Four days prior to admission , he presented to **INSTITUTION with a history as described .
They again told him that he had what could be an ankle open fracture and that he should be immediately treated .
He again elected to leave and then 4 days later presented to the **INSTITUTION Emergency Department .
We were consulted there .
On initial examination , he was afebrile .
He had been on Bactrim orally but has completed that course .
His pain was relatively mild .
His vital signs were normal .
Examination of his leg revealed a moderately swollen ankle .
He has a healing and dry wound on his medial proximal tibia , which has been closed with sutures previously and it was healing without complication .
His ankle is tender to palpation about the lateral ramus where is also has about a 2 - cm linear laceration with very thin border surrounding erythema , which looks actually more like hyperemia from healing process .
They are not infection .
There is some serous drainage from the center of the wound but no gross purulence .
No obvious infection .
The wounds appear to be superficial and not tracking deep .
X-rays performed in the emergency department showed a very minimally displaced lateral malleolus fracture .
In the emergency department he was given Levaquin and placed in a short - leg splint and admitted for IV antibiotics and local wound care .
Prior to putting on the splint , his wound was irrigated with 1 L of normal saline and it was superficially debrided in order to a get a fibrinous dbris .
His wound looked clean .
On hospital day #1 , the day after being seen in the ER , his splint was removed .
He was given a **NAME[VVV] knee brace that could be removed to facilitate wound care .
Hydrogen peroxide 0.5% soaks were started and his wound appear stable .
His pain was stable .
He was afebrile .
He was maintained on the fluoroquinolone pseudomonas because of the seawater exposure as well as any other common aquatic organisms .
He tolerated the soaks well and as his wound was progressing and because of the equal availability of the fluoroquinolone as well as orally and parenterally , he was stated to be stable for discharge to home .
Before discharge , it was discussed with him that if he does begin to develop and infection and if this indeed was initially an open fracture , he does have a chance of developing a deep infection which could require multiple future surgeries to take care of .
In the worse case , he can even end up with an amputation and he understands this .
We told him that he should continue with his 0.5% hydrogen peroxide soaks and the dressing changes .
If he develops any increase in his redness from wearing this now or any increase in his drainage , any fevers , or increasing pain , he was instructed to call the Orthopedic Office .
He should continue with his ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
He would wear a **NAME[VVV] brace and be nonweightbearing on the injured ankle .
He can use crutches for ambulation .
He will follow up with Dr. __________ in his office next Wednesday , **DATE[Jan 17 2008] .
Again , he understood the seriousness of his injury and the importance of proper care .
He was given prescriptions for ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Vicodin 5/500 one to two q.6 hours and Colace while in narcotics .

9. Ambien 10 mg q.h.s. p.r.n. for insomnia
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a **AGE[in 20s] year old right handed white female with history of polysubstance drug abuse who was found unresponsive after last having been seen 18 hours earlier .
She was admitted to **INSTITUTION in **PLACE , PA with severe rhabdomyolysis which led to acute tubular necrosis and renal failure which itself required several dialysis sessions .
Her renal failure began to improve and her last dialysis session occurred six days prior to her admission to **INSTITUTION .
In the hospital she was found to have right sided weakness and bilateral lower extremity weakness of uncertain etiology .
The patient was transferred to **INSTITUTION Harmarville on **DATE[Apr 16 2007] with BUN and creatinine the following day of 35 and 5.6 .
She was maintained on Bumex , but developed shortness of breath and was transferred to **STREET-ADDRESS **INSTITUTION early on the morning of **DATE[Apr 19 2007] .
In the Emergency Department she was given Lasix with success and diuresed a good amount of fluid .
Potassium at the time of admission was low and she required vigorous potassium replacement .
She was therefore admitted to the hospital for acute care .
Initially she was admitted to 3-B , but had to be transferred to the stepdown unit because her pulmonary status showed substantial deterioration .
She was breathing rapidly and working to breath .
In addition she showed evidence for anasarca .
Although she had a good response to diuretic therapy it was felt that she would require one more dialysis session to try to pull off fluid from the lungs and allow her to breath more comfortably .
This was accomplished on the first hospital day .
The patient began to feel more comfortable by the second day .
Her BNP was elevated at 920 .
Creatinine showed substantial improvement all the way through her hospitalization and at the time of discharge her BUN and creatinine had practically normalized with a BUN of 25 and a creatinine of 1.3 .
During this hospitalization she was seen in consultation by Cardiology who did not feel that the patient had intrinsic heart disease despite the elevated BNP .
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed normal left ventricular size and function with an LVEF of 25% .
There was slightly thickened mitral valve leaflets and mild regurgitation , a normal aortic valve , normal right ventricular size and function and no pericardial effusion .
Venous Doppler studies were negative for any evidence to suggest deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities .
During hospitalization the patient showed evidence of labile hypertension .
This was especially associated with anxiety in anticipation of procedures .
On the last hospital day the patient underwent successful left lumbar sympathetic block under fluoroscopy by Pain Management and yet at the time of the preprocedure period her blood pressure was elevated at 154/118 .
The nephrologist recommended use of Clonidine 0.5 mg b.i.d. and 0.1 mg q 2 hours p.r.n.
The patient afterward however responded quite nicely and her blood pressure dropped to 104/80 .
Clearly her hypertension was labile and anxiety related .
I do not believe that she requires the standard routine daily antihypertensive medication at this time .
As mentioned earlier , the patient 's creatinine improved nicely and at the time of discharge was 1.3 .
She did have anasarca at the time of admission , but the use of Lasix and the single dialysis session that she had early during hospitalization helped mobilize that fluid .
It also helped of course to clear her lungs .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr **NAME[PPP] from psychiatry .
During hospitalization her dialysis catheter was removed by Dr **NAME[SSS] .
At the time of discharge the patient is doing quite well .
Her dialysis catheter has been removed .
She has had a procedure for left lumbar sympathetic block under fluoroscopy .
Blood pressure will need to be followed because of variability , but she is breathing quite comfortably .
Her lungs are clear and she is doing well .
Unfortunately the patient is impulsive and therapeutically non-compliant .
There are times during this hospitalization when she left the floor against medical advice in order to smoke cigarettes .
She showed no interest in changing her overall approach to life in terms of polysubstance drug abuse .
She is being returned to **INSTITUTION Harmarville for rehabilitation training given her lower extremity weakness and pain .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Pneumonia .
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation .
3. Mild congestive heart failure , chronic .
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old male with a known history of COPD and coronary artery disease , who presented to an outside hospital with symptoms weakness , production of white sputum , chills without documented fever , general anorexia , dyspnea , and increasing oxygen requirement over his baseline of 2 L diagnosed by x-ray with pneumonia and transferred to **INSTITUTION for further management .
The patient was believed to have a remote history of MRSA which was never confirmed by our review of his records dating back at least 2 years .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Pneumonia :
The patient was treated initially with ceftriaxone and azithromycin based on his history of MRSA .
He was also given vancomycin , starting at the outside hospital , and this was continued here and simplified to moxifloxacin on which he was continued for the remainder of his hospitalization and discharged on the last few days of oral moxifloxacin .
His initial oxygen requirement was 6 L , and this was gradually tapered down overtime , but he still had a baseline requirement of 2 L which was present prior to the hospitalization and was sent home on continued home oxygen .
He did have still increased requirements with exercise and exertion to 3 to 4 L ; however , this was not felt to be an issue in terms of discharge .
2. COPD :
The patient was given a burst of IV steroids , Solu-Medrol which was then converted over to oral steroids prior to discharge .
He was also treated with bronchodilators in order to manage his symptoms of bronchospasm .
3. Coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure :
As mentioned , he was seen by Dr. **NAME[TTT] , who recommended taking an echocardiogram .
This echocardiogram showed mildly decreased LV function and septal dyskinesia secondary to his left bundle branch block .
The degree of dysfunction was considered to be mild .
The patient was also optimized on his CHF management to include an ACE inhibitor , a statin , and a low-dose beta blocker .
No major cardiac events during the hospitalization , and the patient was discharged on these new medications .
4. Deconditioning :
Once the patient 's pneumonia began to resolve , he regained some of his strength and was able to tolerated some mild physical therapy .
He was not felt to qualify for acute rehabilitation and was eventually returned home with home health care .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
The patient 's discharge instructions were to have moderate activity with alternating periods of rest and activity .
He was to continue on a low-salt diet , moderate amounts of fluid , and his respiratory care was to allow up to 4 L of oxygen for the first 2 days of home care , then to be tapered back down to his previous baseline of 2 L .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , clopidogrel 75 mg p.o. daily , Advair 500/50 one puff b.i.d. , isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg p.o. daily , Synthroid 150 mcg p.o. daily , lisinopril 5 mg p.o. daily , moxifloxacin 4 mg p.o. daily for 6 days from the day of discharge making a total of 10 days , multivitamin with minerals 1 capsule p.o. daily , artificial tears 1 drop to both eyes every 6 hours , and prednisone 40 mg p.o. once daily .
He was to follow up with his PCP 1 week following the discharge to determine the rate at which he should be weaned off the prednisone , Combivent inhaler was to be given 4 times daily inhaled .
As mentioned , PCP followup with Dr. **NAME[SSS RRR] in **PLACE , Pennsylvania .
He was to have a chest x-ray 1 month following discharge .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
CHEST DISCOMFORT AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. **NAME[BBB AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old woman with a past medical history significant for end - stage renal disease on hemodialysis Monday / Wednesday / Friday , hypertension , CHF , pulmonary edema , diabetes mellitus , among other diagnoses , who presented herself to **INSTITUTION for follow up with the Vascular Surgery for a recent AV fistula placed on **DATE[Feb 28 2007].
Reportedly , she began to complain of shortness of breath and chest discomfort and she was told to present herself to the **INSTITUTION ER .
At the ER , she was found to have a systolic blood pressure of over 200 and this precipitated her admission to **INSTITUTION Hospital .
Mainly , she was admitted for a rule - out MI and control of her high blood pressure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , CHF , pulmonary edema , hemodialysis Monday / Wednesday / Friday , anemia , diabetes mellitus , neuropathy , retinopathy , CVA with resulting left hemiparesis , dysarthria , anxiety .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
As stated above , the patient was admitted to the hospital mainly for a rule - out MI and hypertensive crisis .
Immediately , we did begin to titrate her medications to assist her pressure in coming down .
She did require p.r.n. hydralazine at times , as her pressure was elevated .
We did increase her lisinopril to 40 mg p.o. each day from 10 mg p.o. each day , which was her outpatient dosage .
We also did consult Renal Service to continue her hemodialysis while in-house , which likely was helping to contribute to her hypertension .
Upon admission , she did have a chest x-ray on **DATE[Mar 25 2007] , which showed mild cardiomegaly with cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature , mild airspace opacity , compatible with mild edema .
After titrating her blood pressure medications and starting dialysis here in the hospital , a repeat chest x-ray on **DATE[Mar 27 2007] , did show no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease and no evidence of pulmonary edema .
Also , BMP done on admission was 1730 , BMP done 2 days later was 668 , indicating better control after fluid removal from hemodialysis .
Overall , the patient 's blood pressures over the next few days did start to come down .
On the day of discharge , her blood pressures are running between 130 and 160 , which for the patient is much improved .
She did have troponins negative x 3 and she did have EKG s which did not show any EKG changes .
It is felt that her chest discomfort is likely due to the pulmonary edema seen on chest x-ray as well as her hypertension .
Both of these are well-controlled .
At this time , the patient is stable and will be ready to be discharged today .
Her Ranexa will be restarted as an outpatient and she will be discharged on lisinopril 40 mg p.o. each day instead of her 10 mg that she was on previously .
At this time , she is felt have reached maximum hospital benefit and is ready to be discharged back to her home .

At this point , it was decided to take the patient for an operative intervention .
Prior to the procedure , the risks and benefits of the procedure , not limited to but most importantly erectile dysfunction , were discussed with the patient .

1. Shortness of breath :
We felt that the patient 's shortness of breath was either likely due to CHF and / or COPD exacerbation .

Per Cardiology , it was felt that the patient had no clinical evidence of any CHF by physical examination or x-ray ; however , the patient did improve subjectively on Lasix , prednisone as well as doxycycline .
It was recommend to continue current treatment .
It was felt that the patient 's mildly elevated BMP was secondary to pulmonary hypertension seen on the patient 's last echocardiogram at last admission .

An outpatient bone marrow biopsy is to be scheduled .
PROCEDURES :
1. Cardiac catheterization .
2. Right coronary artery stent angioplany .
3. Pulmonary function studies .
CONSULTANTS :
1. **NAME[UUU M TTT] , MD , infectious disease .
2. **NAME[CCC M VVV] , MD , hematology / oncology .

BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY :
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old male who initially presented for evaluation at **INSTITUTION where he was complaining of dizziness that had been going on for approximately 1 month .
He is a patient of Dr. **NAME[QQQ PPP] and carries a history of congestive heart failure that has been treated medically , also has had removal of a skin cancer from around the left eye .
His medications included aspirin , nitrates , and diuretics , also included in his list was Vasotec .
At **INSTITUTION , he was found to be in complete heart block with evidence for congestive heart failure and a non - Q - wave myocardial infarction .
He had an emergent dual - chamber permanent pacemaker implanted .
He was treated with diuretics and stabilized with a plan for him to undergo cardiac catheterization .
The patient was brought to **INSTITUTION to undergo that procedure .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Refer to H and P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory by Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] on **DATE[Aug 30 2007] , and the cardiac catheterization findings are as documented .
1. Left main was normal .
2. LAD and his left circumflex had no significant lesions .
3. RCA was large and dominant with a proximal 80% stenosis .
4. LVEF was 55% .
There was evidence for moderate mitral regurgitation .
Intervention included stent dilatation of the RCA that was successful .
Postprocedure , the patient had no complications .
The patient 's platelet count was noted to be 56,000 and his white cell count was elevated to 15,000 .
He was to be seen in consultation by Infectious Disease as well as Hematology specialist , and given the patient 's history of being a chronic smoker and followed in the past by Dr. **NAME[RRR] , pulmonology was also consulted .
The patient was treated by Pulmonology for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchitis .
Full PFTs were ordered .
MDIs and steroids were managed by Dr. **NAME[RRR] .
Infectious disease specialty attributed the elevated white cell count to be secondary to steroid therapy .
The patient will continue on a tapering dose of prednisone as an outpatient .
His blood sugars were also elevated requiring the addition of Micronase 2.5 mg daily .
Regarding thrombocytopenia , it was considered to be multifactorial .
This included drugs i.e. , aspirin , Plavix , and possibly Vasotec .
Aspirin and Plavix were ultimately permitted to be resumed by Hematology with close followup of platelet count .
Vasotec was discontinued .
A bone marrow biopsy is planned after discharge through hematology service .
The patient remained stable otherwise and was considered to be stable for discharge to home .
His pacer site was clean and dry .
He will follow up as indicated above .
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA :
Cardiac catheterization and intervention were already mentioned .
Pulmonary function studies , physician interpretation based on the FEV1/FVC , there was a mild obstructive defect .
Lung volumes were within normal limits .
There was a mild decrease in diffusion capacity .
The reduced diffuse capacity suggested anatomic emphysema .
FVC change by 29% .
This is interpreted as a good response to bronchodilator .
His blood pressure was 120/54 , and he was afebrile .
Lungs had few expiratory wheezes .
Further laboratory data and results , please refer to the hospital chart .

**NAME[BBB M ZZZ]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Jul 25 2007]
DISCHARGE DATE :
**DATE[Jul 27 2007]
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Atrial septal defect / patent foramen ovale closure .
2. Hypertension .
3. History of prostate cancer .
4. Bilateral inguinal hernia repair .
5. Cataract surgeries .
6. Cholecystectomy .
Briefly , the patient is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old gentleman who has been experiencing increasing dyspnea on exertion .
On **DATE[Nov 2006] , he underwent a stress test and he felt mild inferior hypokinesis , and an echocardiogram showed borderline dilated right ventricle and possible atrial septal defect .
He __________ having a transesophageal echocardiogram which confirmed the presence of atrial septal defect with prominent left to right shunting .
On **DATE[Apr 2007] , he underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated mild diffuse coronary artery disease with normal LV systolic function .
A left to right shunt at the atrial level was visualized with probe and patent ASD .
There also was mild secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension with borderline high transpulmonary gradient of 15 mmHg .
Based on these findings , he was asked to return today and undergo an ASD closure .
The atrial septal defect closure was performed with transesophageal echo guidance .
Prior to closure , the transesophageal echo images revealed a 17 - mm secundum atrial septal defect with atrial septal aneurysm .
Significant left to right flow present across the defect .
Right atrium and right ventricle are enlarged .
The atrial septum easily crossed with a multipurpose A2 catheter .
A 22 - mm Amplatzer atrial septal defect occluder was initially placed across the septum , better residual left to right jet was present through a patent foramen ovale .
An attempt was then made to place an 8 - mm atrial septal defect occluder in the tunnel , next to the 22 - mm device in the fossa ovalis .
They were not convinced , the smaller device was stable , so both devices were removed .
A 26 - mm Amplatzer atrial septal device occluder was then placed in the secundum defect , covering both the patent foramen ovale and the atrial septal defect .
No residual shunt was seen .
Post-closure images revealed no significant left to right shunt .
However , a __________ done by the patient on room air revealed an oxygen step - up in the mid right atrium as follows :
The SVC saturation was 63% , mid RA 84% , RV 81% , main PA 81% .
Values repeated and were found to be consistent .
Repeat transesophageal echocardiogram imaging confirmed that all 4 pulmonary veins empty into the left atrium .
A trivial left to right jet was seen through the device as is commonly present at the end of these procedures .
An aortogram showed no evidence of a patent ductus .
Femoral venous saturation from the sheath was 67% .
The IVC saturation near the junction of the RA was 85% .
Bubble studies from the pulmonary artery fields revealed any evidence of left to right shunting from that site .
The sheaths were then sutured in place , and the patient was returned to his room .
Status post the procedure , the ASD closure device was successful .
However , etiology of residual O2 step - up in the right atrium is unclear .
A right lower pulmonary vein to the IVC connection is possible , and an MRI was ordered the following day .
The MRI was performed here at **INSTITUTION .
The results are not available to me at this time of dictation .
However , it is recommended that he have a repeat MRI in 2 to 4 weeks to evaluate the atrial septal defect and the PFO as well as evaluate the closure device itself and to evaluate the site to possibly reveal any explanation for the residual shunt .
That was explained to the patient ; a prescription was given to him .
For discharge today , his sodium was 140 , potassium 3.6 , chloride 102 , CO2 of 30 , BUN 9 , creatinine 1.1 , hemoglobin 15.1 , hematocrit 42.4 .
An echocardiogram also was performed after the procedure , which demonstrated normal left ventricle size and function with an ejection fraction of 55% to 60% .
Mild aortic regurgitation .
No signs of tamponade were seen , and the Amplatz or occluder device in the atrial septum had no obvious intracardiac shunting by color Doppler .
The patient has continued to feel well without any symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
General :
Today , he is afebrile .
Vital Signs :
Heart rate is in the 80 s , respirations 16 .
Blood pressure before medication is 140 s to 150 s over 50 s to 60 s .

REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old female well until **DATE[Jan 2007] when she presented with AML and a bone marrow biopsy showing
80% to 90% cellularity and 62% blasts .
AML was categorized as M4 with multiple cytogenetic abnormalities .
She underwent idarubicin and ARA-C induction with a day 14 bone marrow biopsy showing less than 5% blasts .
A followup bone marrow biopsy in **DATE[Feb 2007] showed less than 5% blasts ; however , cytogenetics were consistent with residual disease .
Her blood counts were allowed to recover , and bone marrow biopsy done on **DATE[Mar 23 2007] , noted relapse disease with 80% blasts for which she underwent re-induction with mitoxantrone and etoposide .
A bone marrow biopsy done on day 14 noted persistent disease with 22% residual blasts , and at that point , she was transferred to the bone marrow transplant service for transplant .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. AML .
The patient began conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide which she tolerated well .
Day 0 was **DATE[Apr 21 2007] , at which point , she received her stem cell infusion for a total dose of five times ten to the sixth CD34 - positive cells , and she engrafted her white blood cell count on day plus 15 .
2. Graft - versus - host disease .
She received cyclosporine and methotrexate graft - versus - host disease prophylaxis .
She did not receive methotrexate on day 11 due to severe mucositis .
At the time of discharge and for a few days prior to discharge , the patient noted tenderness on her fingers and her heels which have remained unchanged which has been attributed to her busulfan .
3. Infectious disease .
During the course of the hospitalization , the patient was on meropenem and vancomycin which she was on when she transferred from the leukemia service .
She has had no positive blood cultures .
Her antibiotics were stopped with her engraftment , and she has remained afebrile .
She has also continued on acyclovir and fluconazole prophylaxis .
In her posttransplant course , she did experience episodes of diarrhea , and at time of discharge , is having approximately three very small stools per day .
Samples have been sent for Clostridium difficile x 3 , all of which are negative .
4. Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition .
The patient has reported IV magnesium replacement , at least 2 g per day .
Because she has continued to have diarrhea , a decision was made for her to continue with IV magnesium at home .
On **DATE[May 12 2007] , the patient was felt to be in stable condition and prepared for discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Medications at discharge include :
1. Acyclovir 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily .
3. Cyclosporine 125 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Diflucan 200 mg p.o. daily .
5. Prilosec 40 mg p.o. daily .

7. Compazine 10 mg p.o. q.4 hours p.r.n. nausea or vomiting .
8. Ambien 5 mg p.o. at bedtime p.r.n. insomnia .
The patient was scheduled to return back to the outpatient stem cell transplant clinic on Tuesday , **DATE[May 13 2007] , at 8:45 a.m. for followup evaluation and lab work .
She was instructed to call with any questions or concerns .
She will be staying at her son **NAME[VVV] 's house .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Dec 13 07]
I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male with pancreatitis complicated by development of phlegmon and superior mesenteric artery aneurysm .
He is status post repair , now transferred back to the intensive care unit for fever , chills , rigor with presumed sepsis .
Over the course of the evening , he has become progressively more hypoxemic and required intubation .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the general surgeons and with the infectious disease consultants .
His problems and management are as follows :
1. Sepsis :
The etiology of his deterioration is unclear , but he appears to be septic at T max of 39.3 .
Of note , he was complaining of abdominal pain prior to intubation .
LFT s show an obstructive pattern , and a dye study through the drain appears to show , to my read , a leak through the common bile duct .
Currently , we have consulted the GI / Hepatology service , as well as the hepatic surgeons to evaluate .
In the meantime , I have started him empirically on broad spectrum gram - negative and gram - positive coverage for ID 's recommendations .
I am awaiting definitive recommendations from the hepatologist and the surgeons about the possibility of source control with the drainage , either percutaneously or open .
His hemodynamics have been stable , and I have not needed to start him on vasopressors , although he has required multiple fluid boluses for hypotension .
2. Respiratory failure :
Chest x-ray last night developed rapid occurrence of bilateral fluffy infiltrates consistent with ARDS .
He is now on the ventilator .
I have dropped his tidal volumes from 550 to 450 today and then again down to 350 to get him at 6 ml / kilogram .
Peak airway pressures have remained less than 30 .
I have been able increase his PEEP to 12 and wean his FiO2 down gradually to 60% .
I have left him on a Fentanyl infusion for pain control with intermittent Versed for sedation .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .

I am managing this critically - ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male with severe pancreatitis and multiple complications , which have been documented previously in the medical record .
I am seeing this patient for management of his hypotension , sepsis , respiratory failure , and his pancreatitis .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and Emtek data and discussed the management with the general surgeons , vascular surgeons , and the hepatic surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows an increase in his bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS .
On the vent , I have him on assist-control .
He developed some air hunger last night when I dropped his tidal volume from 450 to 350 and his tidal volume had been increased over the evening .
I would like to keep his tidal volume at 350 , to keep his plateau pressures low , and consistent with a 6 mL / kg .
To that end , I have increased his sedation today and dropped his tidal volumes to 350 .
He seems to be doing reasonably well .
Gas exchange is moderately impaired at 50% FiO2 and 12 of PEEP .
I will do bronchoscopy today to evaluate the ARDS and to rule out a possible pneumonia as a cause of his sepsis .
2. Sepsis .
White blood cell count is dropping today to 5000 , which is consistent with his previous septic episodes as well .
I have him on broad-spectrum gram negative and gram positive coverage including colistin for his multidrug resistant Pseudomonas , as well as tigecycline for extended gram positive coverage , as well as good gram negative and anaerobic coverage for possible intraabdominal abscess .
He did go down for a PTC catheter today , and he has done clinically well after that with a reasonable amount of drainage in the bag .
He has become somewhat more septic after his PTC catheter with peripheral vasodilation , hypotension , and overall sepsis physiology .
He is not responding to fluid resuscitation , and I have started him on a norepinephrine infusion , titrated for a mean arterial pressure of
65 .
3. ICU prophylaxis .
He has stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
I have held off on resuming his tube feeds for another 24 hours in light of his worsening sepsis today .
TOTAL CRITICAL CARE TIME EQUALS 40 MINUTES EXCLUDING PROCEDURES .
PROCEDURE NOTE :
Bronchoscopy .
INDICATIONS :
Respiratory failure / ARDS .
DESCRIPTION :
The patient is sedated Versed and vecuronium .
The fiberoptic bronchoscope was inserted through the endotracheal tube and advanced into the airway .
Evaluation of the right upper , right middle , and right lower lobe , as well as the left upper , left lingula , and left lower lobe are essentially unremarkable .
CT scan of the chest revealed significant involvement in the superior segments of the bilateral left lower lobes .
In light of this finding , I have wedged the bronchoscope in the superior segments of the right upper lobe and instilled 120 mL or sterile normal saline into two 60 mL _________ with a return of about 40 mL of aspirate .
I sent this off to the microbiology laboratory for evaluation .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
I was present for and supervised the entire procedure .
PROCEDURE NOTE :
Femoral arterial line .
INDICATIONS :
Hypotension .
DESCRIPTION :
The patient 's left groin is prepped times two minutes of Chlorhexidine , full sterile barriers are applied including hat , mask , gown , glove , and large sterile drape .
The left femoral artery was accessed on the second pass with a needle .
The wire and 5 - French catheter advanced using Selinger technique without complications .
Sutured into place .
I was present for and supervised the entire procedure .

The patient was personally seen and examined .
The case was discussed with the house staff , and I agree with the plan as outlined in their note .
Overnight , the patient was transfused 1 unit of blood and with 80 mg of IV Lasix , and she seemed to tolerate it well with no increased shortness of breath .
Last night at approximately 1 a.m. , she was noted to have decreased mental status , and house staff evaluated her and found she had a glucose of 12 .
She was given 2 amps of D-50 and narcan though she is not on any narcotics though , and her glucose slowly improved to 120 with improvement in her mental status .
It is unclear why her glucose came so low .
She was given 4 units of insulin at 9 p.m. for a glucose of 223 .
She has tolerated insulin sliding scale in the past , and she is on no other medications that apparently will cause hypoglycemia .
Currently , the patient says she feels great .
She denies any shortness of breath or chest pain .
She also says her thinking is normal , and she does not feel sweaty in any way .
She is also very appreciative of the bilateral myringotomy tubes that were placed yesterday .
She now can hear much better .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital Signs :
She is afebrile .
Her blood pressure is 105/61 , she is 97% on 3 liters , slightly increased from yesterday .
General :
On exam , the patient looks well and lying down flat in her bed with no acute distress .
HEENT :
On exam , her oropharynx is normal .
Neck :
Her JVP seems to be elevated than yesterday .
Lungs :
She has light crackles at both of her bases today .
Heart :
Regular rate and rhythm .
Abdomen :
Soft .
She has no significant edema .
LABS :
Her lab work was notable for after posttransfusion hemoglobin was 9.6 , after 1 unit __________ 7.8 .
Her BUN was 22 and her creatinine was 1.2 .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
The patient has done overall .
1. GI bleed that prompted her first presentation .
After speaking with the GI fellow and discussions , it appeared that she has continued to have a very low - level bleed from her diverticulosis .
It is felt that at this time that there is no role for further endoscopy to work this up , and she is hemodynamically stable .
We gave her an extra transfusion yesterday to bring up her baseline , and this will just have to be followed up as an outpatient .
She will also follow up with her outpatient gastroenterologist to see if he also wants to intervene though again she is a poor candidate for endoscopy with her other comorbidities .
2. Pulmonary status and her congestive heart failure , likely with the transfusion and IV Lasix she did not go into flash pulmonary edema .
She did just several days ago ; nonetheless , it is apparent that with her elevated JVP , slight hypoxia , and also her crackles on exam , that she can get benefit from some extra IV Lasix .
We gave her 40 mg of that today and then restarted to her baseline regimen .
3. Overnight , hypoglycemia and altered mental status .
It appears this is secondary to hypoglycemia .
Why she went into hypoglycemia is unclear as she ate a good dinner last night and has tolerated small doses of insulin in the past ; nonetheless , since her last hypoglycemia of 12 , she has been followed for 12 hours with good glucoses over 100 .
Clearly , her thinking is back to normal also .
We have discontinued the insulin sliding scale for her .
4. The patient was set to go to back to her nursing home today .
I am comfortable with that as long as her glucoses through the afternoon remain stable and her respiratory status improves after this IV Lasix which I am very confident it will .
She should follow up with both her cardiologist and her gastroenterologist and primary care physician in the next 1 to 2 weeks to follow up on these issues .

I reviewed the consultation note from the Infectious Disease Service from **DATE[Nov 19 2007] .
I discussed the case with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] .
Please insert my note linked to Dr. **NAME[UUU] .
The patient feels fairly well this morning but did have fever up to 100.4 yesterday .
He had some fleeting right - sided back pain but that has completely resolved .
He denies headaches , cough , chest pain or dyspnea , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea or constipation .
The patient has had several of the urine cultures positive for Candida and it is possible that this is a Candida bacteremia with possible abscess formation , then the perinephric fluid collection , or that he might have a bacterial abscess .
There is also the possibility that he might have ceded his pleural effusion at the suggestion of the Infectious Disease Service , we have stopped his Zosyn but continued him on intravenous fluconazole .
We will contact IR for drainage of the perinephric abscess and I would be inclined to also do a diagnostic thoracentesis at the same time .
The patient is comfortable today .
We will continue him on his present regimen .

I discussed the situation with Dr. **NAME[UUU] who did his cystoscopy and retrograde today , and it appears that the problem is that he has bladder outlet obstruction from prostatic hypertrophy .
There is no evidence of malignancy .
Dr. **NAME[UUU] would like to proceed with a definitive surgical procedure in a few weeks , but would like for his infection to be under better control before proceeding .
The plan at this point is to treat him with antifungal agents for at least 2 more weeks , and to follow with Dr. **NAME[UUU] and myself .
He may be ready for discharge later today .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 23 07]
I personally interviewed and examined the patient on **DATE[Nov 23 2007] .
I discussed the case with Dr. **NAME[VVV] .
Please consider my note linked to his note .
The patient is actually doing well at this time , although he is complaining of a variety of issues including some urinary tract bleeding and persistent mild fever .
He denies any chest pain or dyspnea .
He denies abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , diarrhea or constipation .
On physical examination , his temperature is 99.5 .
His blood pressure is unchanged from previous recordings .
Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion .
Heart , regular rhythm .
Abdomen soft and nontender .
His memory seemed to be slightly impaired today .
He did not remember some of the conversations that I had with him on **DATE[Nov 22 2007] .
However , he was awake and alert and able to answer questions .
I also talked to the patient 's wife about his clinical situation .
His BUN is 15 , creatinine 1.1 .
His glucose is 109 .
White count this morning was 9200 .
Hemoglobin and hematocrit have remained stable .
He was 9.2 and 26.4 before his procedure , yesterday .
He is 9.4 and 27.3 this morning .
His INR is 2.2 and he is to remain in the therapeutic range .
He does have pink tinge to urine .
IMPRESSION AND PLAN :
This patient is doing well .
I believe his bleeding is minor , relative to his procedure .
The plan is for him to continue with fluconazole for at least 2 weeks .
He will then follow up with Dr. **NAME[UUU] and have another scan done .
Ultimately , he will need to have his prostate removed by Dr. **NAME[TTT] and arrangements are being made for that at this time .
The patient should be able to be discharged to home today with a Foley in place to continue on present therapy with anticoagulation and fluconazole .
He will need to be put on low molecular weight heparin in preparation for his surgical procedure as he does have an artifical valve .

Subjective
Complaints abdominal swelling - much improved s/p paracenthesis / minimal leak of serous fliud overnight d/w pt at length regarding treatment and need for close follow up - he understands and is aggreeable however , he is not agreeable to Acute ETOH rehab as it has not helped in the past and hearing about other peoples ' problems only makes him anxious .
He also is hesitant to go to out patient rehab as he may be called back to work .
He feels he can quit etoh on his own because he knows he will otherwise die .
I informed him that work is not an exuse as if he does not qiut etoh and go to all his appts and check his sugars regularly - he will not be alive to go to work .
He still is against rehab .
I told him we will set him up with rehab and it will be up to him .

I am managing this critically ill , **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male who is postoperative day #1 from a repeat laparotomy with a washout in evaluation of mesenteric perfusion after repair of a superior mesenteric false aneurysm .
I am seeing him for management of his respiratory failure and his multiple medical issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the vascular surgeons .
PROBLEMS AND MANAGEMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS :
1. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows endotracheal tube in good position .
His Duotube , which was placed in the Operating Room , is coiled in the back of his mouth , although the tip of the Duotube is posterior to the pylorus .
On the vent right now , I have him on assist control .
His peak airway pressure , his minute ventilation and gas exchange are adequate .
Today I have cut his fentanyl infusion in half and will do a pressure support trial to see if we can work on weaning and extubation .
2. Status post SMA repair .
Hemodynamics have been adequate .
His cardiac output and index are high , in the range of 10 to 12 liters a minute consistent with vasodilation .
Mean arterial pressures have been adequate as has his urine output .
I suspect that his vasodilated state will resolve over the next 48 to 72 hours .
He has not required any vasopressors and he is on prophylactic antibiotics including ciprofloxacin , Flagyl and vancomycin after his SMA repair .
3. ICU prophylaxis .
I have increased his prophylactic heparin to q.8 hours .
He remains N.P.O. at this point .
Will begin trickle feeding him in the next 48 hours or so .
I have fixed his coiled Duotube using a laryngoscope and Magill forceps and advancing it down the esophagus .
I have stabilized it down the esophagus and pulled the kink out of the Duotube and now it is in adequate position .
Total Critical Care time equals 40 minutes .

The patient was seen and evaluated as a Condition C for unresponsiveness .
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old , white male who was admitted on **DATE[Aug 18 2007] to the Cardiology Service for chest pain , coronary artery disease , and hypertensive urgency .
The patient had a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease , hypertension , and also , the patient has carotid ultrasound with left-sided plaque .
The patient was stabilized in the Pavilion Service and eventually went on **DATE[Aug 22 2007] with Dr. **NAME[RRR ZZZ] for CABG times four , LIMA to LAD and SVG to OM1 , OM2 , and PDA .
The patient 's postoperative TEE shows LV and RV preserved function with an approximate EF of 55% , and the patient postoperatively in the CTICU began to have atrial fibrillation and was started on amiodarone drip .
The patient was extubated in the morning and transferred to the floor on 6D where later on in the afternoon , he brady down to the 40s in the early afternoon .
Amiodarone drip was stopped .
The patient was placed on his temporary cardiac pacers at a rate of 60 .
The patient continued to mentate , however , was groggy since approximately 04:00 in the evening .
The patient has progressed with increasing mental status changes , and the patient was eventually found to be diaphoretic and fairly unresponsive and Condition C was called at midnight .
The patient , at Condition C time , was found to be bag valve mask assisted , unresponsive to deep , painful stimuli .
Accu - Chek was 140 done by nursing prior to our arrival .
The patient also had not received any narcotics at all .
The patient also was hypotensive with blood pressures in the 80s systolic .
The patient was immediately intubated .
It was thought the patient did have a good pulse , however , in the femoral area , and the patient was intubated with no drugs with 8-0 endotracheal tube without difficulty .
The patient continued to be unresponsive , however , now hypertensive with blood pressures in the 140s and 150s .
At that time , we then prepped for a sterile right IJ introducer placement as there not an immediately available bed in CTICU .
The patient had a right IJ introducer placed without difficulty .
Please see other procedure notes for further details .
The patient unfortunately began to wake up during the procedure of placement of the right IJ and became purposeful , trying to localize pain with bilateral extremities .
The patient was given 2 mg of Versed only , which dropped the patient 's pressures back into the 80s , however , still continued to have a good pulse .
IV fluids with normal saline was wide open through peripheral vein , and the patient was started on dobutamine at 5 mcg / kg / min .
After the introducer was placed , we called Cardiology for a stat echocardiogram at bedside on 6D , and the patient was getting a 2-D echocardiogram , which showed EF depression globally , EF of approximately 40% , RV hypokinesis , and enlarged IVC .
IV fluids were then slowed down to 100 mL / hour , and overall , the patient 's first venous blood gases showed SvO2 of 50% and pH of 6.9 .
The patient was given 2 amps of bicarb immediately , and the patient 's blood pressure was not improved .
The patient had D5W with 3 amps of bicarb infusion made , and this was running through the patient 's IV while another amp of bicarb and a gram of calcium was given to the patient .
The patient continued to have echocardiography performed by the Cardiology fellow , which continued to show depressed global hypokinesis with EF of only 40% .
No tamponade or other external pericardial effusions were seen .
The patient began to have decreased pulse and was seen on echo to have cardiac arrest .
Condition A was called at this time , approximately 02:00 a.m. , and the chest was opened at the bedside by Cardiothoracic Surgery , and open cardiac massage was continued .
Meanwhile , total closed chest time CPR was approximately 10 minutes , total rounds of epi was 5 , total rounds of bicarb was 6 , and total grams of calcium was 2 .
The patient continued to have severe metabolic acidosis with bicarb initially of 7-9 on initial electrolytes , K of 5.2 , 10 U insulin and 1 amp D50 glucose were also given IV , and the patient continued to have metabolic acidosis .
Post resuscitation after return of pulse and spontaneous circulation after open cardiac massage , the patient 's ABG was 7.19 , CO2 of 38 , PaO2 of 376 , and bicarb 14 .
The patient was given 2 more amps of bicarb and transported to the operating room for washout for tamponade .
The resident updated Dr. **NAME[RRR ZZZ] , and the family was in the waiting room .
TOTAL CRITICAL CARE TIME SPENT WITH THIS PATIENT WAS 100 MINUTES .

I am currently seeing this **AGE[in 70s]- year - old gentleman initially status post CABG , postop day number two .
Postop course has been complicated with initial respiratory , followed by cardiac arrest up on 6 D .
Currently I am managing his hemodynamics and inotropic support .
I examined him , reviewed his laboratory data , chart data , and chest x-ray .
Hemodynamically , the patient did undergo open chest arrest on the floor and went to the OR , was placed on a pump .
The vessels were found to be patent .
A balloon pump was placed , he came out open on 0.2 of " epi " and vasopressin at 0.02 mcg / kg / min .
Initial cardiac index was 1.8 .
Dopamine was started and index did improve .
" Epi " is now down to 0.075 mcg / kg / min .
Lactate continues to improve , now down to 6.4 .
Balloon remains in and was ________ at 1:1 .
So hemodynamically he currently is improving .
His issue at this point in time is neurologic .
This morning he started to have some twitching , initially appearing like it was mono clonus .
I did order a STAT EEG which did confirm burst suppression .
So the patient at this point is with a devastating neurologic injury , anoxic in nature .
I did discuss with the family concerning results of the EEG , that it did mean that he did have an extremely poor prognosis of recovery , but at this point in time we will give him a few more days and follow up on repeat EEG , and then assess at that point in time .
The patient 's family did express that if he was not going to neurologically recover , that they did not want to continue care , at that point in time they would like to make him comfort measures only .
Otherwise , from a ventilatory standpoint , his A-a gradient has improved .
He is down to 40% and he is on 5 of PEEP .
His sats are in the high 90s to 100% .
Otherwise , his hematocrit has been stable , no evidence of bleeding .
He did get some products this morning for an INR of 2 , ________  , some cryo , and some platelets for a platelet count of 63,000 .
INR is coming down , platelet count is improved .
In light of this , I did not transfuse any more products .
Will follow with repeat coags in the morning .
I did put him on prophylactic vancomycin in light his chest was open and he is on Protonix for GI prophylaxis .
So at this point in time , we have a gentleman , **AGE[in 70s] years of age , status post respiratory and cardiac arrest , now with anoxic brain injury with burst suppression and poor prognosis for any neurological recovery .
So , we will see what he does over the next 24 to 48 hours , although I think it is unlikely he is going to make any neurological recovery , reassess him and then discuss with the family where they want to proceed from that point on .
Otherwise , continue his current supportive care and management .
CRITICAL CARE TIME = 40 MINUTES .

I am continuing to see this **AGE[in 70s]- year - old gentleman status post CABG , postop course complicated with cardiac arrest and now with severe anoxic encephalopathy with burst suppression on EEG yesterday .
Hemodynamically he remains unchanged index ___________ 2.5 .
He continues on 5 mcg of dopamine as well as epinephrine at 0.1 .
Also he became a little bit vasodilated overnight and ended up back on the Vasopressin at 0.02 units per minute .
The balloon pump remains in ___________ at 1:1 .
From a respiratory standpoint the AA gradient remains stable .
The patient , also of note , with elevated LFT s secondary to a shocked liver .
Neurologically patient still with mono clonus worse than yesterday clinically .
I am continuing him on propofol for suppression of this activity in light that his jerking notably makes the family uncomfortable .
I did have another discussion with the patient 's family .
I did again inform them that he appears to be having more mono clonus activity , has not shown any recovery , and his prognosis remains extremely poor as far as neurological recovery .
I did speak to them again about what their wishes would be in light of note that he is unlikely to recover .
They again did express to me that he would not want to live like this .
They did want to proceed ahead , as per their wishes , to get an EEG in the morning , and if he still has burst suppression on the EEG , at that point in time they did want to make him comfortable .
But of note , his birthday is apparently tomorrow , so their wish is not to withdraw support on Friday , but likely wait until Saturday .
I told them whatever made them comfortable as far as getting through this process would be acceptable to me .
I did discuss with them that if his heart should stop or he should have a lethal arrhythmia , that we should not do any chest compressions or any defibrillation on him , and his wife was in agreement to this .
Otherwise she did want to continue current management and clinical care .
So , at this point in time , we will proceed ahead , get the EEG tomorrow , and otherwise continue his current supportive care and management .

The patient was seen and examined by myself .
Laboratory value and chest x-ray film were reviewed by myself .
He remains in the intensive care unit suffers from the following problems :
1. Laryngeal cancer .
The patient is status post laryngectomy and bilateral radical neck dissection .
The patient will continue to be monitored in the intensive care unit .
2. Respiratory failure .
The patient is on mechanical ventilation .
He has a significant history of COPD .
I am planning to start him again on theophylline and also we will use albuterol , Atrovent , and if he requires steroids we will use that , however no need for it right now .
We will switch him to pressure support ventilation and will wean / titrate pressure support to keep his respiratory rate less than 20 .
Hopefully we will try him on tracheostomy mask later on today .
I spent a total of 33 minutes assessing , evaluating , and managing Mr. **NAME[AAA] .

I am managing this critically ill , **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male , status post repair of an SMA aneurysm , hospital course complicated by respiratory failure .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and Emtek data , and discussed the management with the vascular surgeons and general surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Status post repair of SMA aneurysm .
He remains on prophylactic antibiotics with Cipro , Flagyl , and vancomycin .
On examination today , his abdomen this morning was significantly more distended than it had been previously .
He has tenderness in the bilateral lower quadrants , but no peritoneal signs .
His lactate is less than 1. I have ordered q.6 hourly lactate and arterial blood gas checks today in light of his increasing abdominal pain .
The differential diagnosis includes mesenteric ischemia , a mesenteric venous thrombosis , or possible reperfusion syndrome .
Over the course of the day , we have also been measuring his intra - abdominal pressures on a q.2 hourly basis .
Those started out higher today at 20 .
This afternoon , his abdomen feels somewhat less distended than it did this morning and his abdominal pressures are down to 13 .
We will continue to follow his lactates and arterial blood gases for the next 24 hours .
I have left him n.p.o. in light of his abdominal distention .
2. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows the duo-tube coiled in his posterior pharynx .
ET tube is in place , and he has left basilar atelectasis .
On the vent , I have left him on assist control .
His peak airway pressures have been adequate .
He has a mild respiratory acidosis in addition to his metabolic acidosis , and I think this is due to fentanyl as he does not overbreathe the vent .
I have decreased his minute ventilation slightly in order to start getting him to breathe over the vent but have not done any other vent weaning .
3. ICU prophylaxis .
I am cutting back his IV fluids today .
His urine output has been adequate .
He feels warm , dry , and well-perfused .
He remains n.p.o. at this point .
He has stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor and subcutaneous heparin .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[YYY M ZZZ]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Dec 17 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Dec 19 07]
I was asked by Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] 's to see this **AGE[in 50s]- year - old patient status post two-vessel coronary bypass grafting surgery .
I was asked to manage him for a hemodynamic / cardiovascular standpoint and also from a respiratory standpoint .
I examined , her reviewed her laboratory data and chest x-ray .
Hemodynamically the patient came out of the OR on phenylephrine which was weaned off shortly after she came out .
She subsequently became hypertensive requiring her to go on some nitroprusside .
Her initial cardiac index was 1.7 .
The patient reportedly had a stiff neck , noncompliant heart and off pump .
In light of this I did give her 500 cc of Hextend and her index improved to 2.5 .
Subsequent index was now down to 22 .
Blood pressure is reasonable , mean is still in the mid 60 s.
She is still on nitroprusside .
CVP is now down to 12 .
I did give her an additional 500 cc of Hextend for a total of 1 liter .
Crit initially when she came out was 27 , will probably repeat crit after this second 500 cc bolus .
Otherwise , she has been in normal sinus rhythm in the 70 s.
She is making good urine .
From a respiratory standpoint she initially came out with an increased A-a gradient with a pO2 of 103 .
She was recruited , dropped to 60% and subsequently has been weaned at 40% with improvement of her A-a gradient .
When she does awaken if she clinically continues to do well , we should be able to get her extubated .
She has had no postoperative bleeding .
She is on insulin drip 80:110 protocol for hyperglycemic control .
We will continue to titrate insulin accordingly .
Otherwise , I will continue her current supportive care and management .
Critical care time = 36 minutes .

Chart , including 36 - hr rounding reprot , reviewed .
Patient was seen and examined , discussed with the FHC Residents .
History and physical exam were reviewed .
Concur with assessment and plan .
Notations below .
-- see H&amp;P and my admit note .
-- when pt was seen early this morning she was reluctant to speak with me and only consented to a physical exam , and did not answer other questions other than to say she did not feel like talking at the time .
-- she is know to me from prior admission to the FHC case .
her case is a prolonged , sad , and deteriorting one .
-- prolong hospitalization can exacerbate some of her Axis I and II conditions
-- we will stabilize her FEN , initiate c.dif abx , and when we can proceed safely and effecitvely with further mgt as outpt we will .
-- till then will con 't active inpt pmgt of her baseline outpt issue .
-- minimizing the number of active meds has been a goal in the past as i recall .
still would add Vit D 400 IU BID and Calcium 600 mg BID , as well as MVI with folate .
-- further address BP meds .
currently only on CCB .
re-assess BP after dialysis .
-- t/c d/c lipitor b/c of limited M&amp ; M effect in pts on dialysis .

I personally interviewed and examined the patient .
The care plan was discussed with the resident team .
Please consider this note linked to the resident note .
The patient has had an uneventful night .
She declined ambulating with physical therapy yesterday .
She says she is too tired .
She did state that she is having discomfort in her left knee .
This is increased over the last several days .
She states this is not why she is not wanting to walk .

Mouth is without lesions .
Skin exam is unchanged .
LABORATORY DATA :
Labs are detailed in the resident note and reviewed by me in their entirety .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1. Heme .
She has positive lupus anticoagulant .
To my knowledge , she has never had a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism , which would indicate right lung or even would indicate the need for anticoagulation .
Her legs are unimpressive for DVT at this time , and I would , however , in light of knee pain , consider Doppler , although the yield would be low .
2. Left knee pain .
Rheumatology is following .
Will ask whether they think arthrocentesis is indicated .
Joint is not warm to touch , but is tender , and there is a slight effusion .
She has decreased flexion secondary to pain .
3. ID .
Changing to Augmentin today .

Please consider this note linked to the resident note .
The patient has had an uneventful night .
She is feeling relatively well this morning .
Her affect is brighter , and she states she would be agreeable to having the Foley catheter discontinued and using a bedside commode .
The Foley catheter was placed initially to better evaluate her volume status , but ultimately because of discomfort with urination , it was kept in place because of her vaginal wounds .

She is afebrile .
Blood pressure is 140/69 , heart rate 98 , and temperature is 37.2 .
General :
She has a brighter affect , smiles today for the first time that I have seen .
Her lungs are clear to auscultation .
Heart sounds regular rate and rhythm .
Skin is unchanged .
Labs are detailed in the resident note and are reviewed by me in their entirety and are notable for her being guaiac - positive with a white count that is up to 13.6 today from 8.4 yesterday with 79% neutrophils .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. ID .
Wound culture has not yet been reported .
She was placed on Augmentin 250 t.i.d. on the third .
Her white count is slightly elevated ; today , she remains afebrile .
I will continue to monitor .
Clinically , she is much improved .
2. Hypertension .
This does appear to be persisting .
It could be secondary to her steroids however .
We will not treat at this point .
3. Lupus .
On Plaquenil .
Following CBC and steroids .
4. GU .
Discontinue Foley , get bedside commode .
5. Disposition .
Yet to hear if the patient is walking , and we need to assess this to better judge what would be the best discharge plan for her .

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Please see medical history sheet in the chart .
My note should be considered linked to Dr. **NAME[XXX] 's .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital Signs :
Her blood pressure today was 124/77 .
Her pulse was 89 .
Her temperature was 97.8 .
HEENT :
Her oral mucosa was moist .
Neck :
Supple .
I did not feel any discrete nodule .
She had a right carotid bruit .
Lungs :
Significant for crackles at her right base .
Heart :
Normal S1 and S2 .
She has 1/6 murmur at the left midsternal border .
Her PMI was nondisplaced .
Breasts :
Without prominent mass , dimpling , or retraction .
I did not feel any significant axillary or cervical adenopathy .
Abdomen :
Soft .
She has some mild tenderness in her epigastric region today .
Her bowel sounds were positive and normoactive .
Extremities :
Some trace edema in her ankles .
She has extensive vitiligo changes in her skin .
I did not see any clubbing .
Neurologic :
Strength exam , she had some mild weakness to her left grip and has had some just very mild drift on the left .
Her finger - to - nose was on target .
Her lower extremity strength , I thought , was 5- / 5 bilateral and symmetric .
There was no clonus , no Babinski .
Her face was symmetric .
Extraocular movements were intact .
There were clear __________ .
She did look quite pale .
LABORATORY DATA :
She was quite anemic with white count of 14 today .
Hemoglobin was 7.6 .
Her platelet count was 675 .
Her white count was 596 .
The last time she was in the hospital , she had high ferritin , low iron saturation consistent with probable anemia of chronic disease .
She has a sedimentation rate today of 120 .
Her C-reactive protein was 22 .
Her chest x-ray was read as unremarkable .
She had blood cultures drawn yesterday , which are negative at 1 day .
UA is still pending .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Complaints of weakness and leukocytosis with increased muscle achiness .
With her elevated sedimentation rate and CRP , in general a vague symptomatology , I suspect that she may have vasculitis .
She does have persisted hematuria in her urine .
She could have PAN , possibly of temporal arteries given her headaches .
We plan on setting her up for a temporal artery biopsy .
We will have Rheumatology see her again to do an EMG nerve conduction study if her temporal artery biopsy is negative .
If she has evidence of neuropathy then we would consider a nerve biopsy .
There is not any apparent malignancy , but if our evaluation for vasculitis is negative , then we will ask Hematology to consider bone marrow biopsy .
She obviously has some significant illness causing her to develop a profound anemia of chronic disease and general inability to function .
We need to determine what that chronic disease is .
2. Crackles on her lung exam .
X-rays reportedly are negative .
She just had a CT scan last admission .
This admission would consider repeating high - resolution CT scan of her chest to reevaluate her right lung if her vascular workup is negative .
3. Anemia and vitiligo .
We will check a B12 although I think her main problem is anemia of chronic disease .
We will make sure there is no associated B12 deficiency as well .
4. Hematuria .
We will repeat a urinalysis today .
Her renal function is normal .
I suspect that her hematuria maybe associated with her illness .
5. Hypertension , controlled .
Her case was discussed in detail with the house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
My note should be considered linked to theirs .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is doing about the same today .
She was seen by Vascular and they were trying to take her to the OR tomorrow .
She continues to complain of some dizziness when she gets up quickly .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On her exam today , the finger - nose was on target .
There was mild symmetric drift .
Her upper extremity strength was 5/5 .
Lower extremity strength was also 5/5 with exception of some mild proximal weakness in her shoulders .
Her tandem walking , she is unable to do but she is able to stand and walk on her heels and her toes .
We tried to do a BNA when we took her back .
She developed profound dizziness , had to close her eyes and sat back up .
It looked like a positive test but she would not let us evaluate her eyes for nystagmus .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Increased sedimentation rate , increased WBC count , and anemia .
She is to undergo temporal artery biopsy .
We discussed her case with Rheumatology .
They suggested repeating her EMG nerve conduction study in case her biopsy is negative .
We already have those tests on board as we may proceed with muscle nerve biopsy and bone marrow biopsy as well .
2. Vertigo .
Her symptoms are somehow suggestive of a peripheral vertigo , probably benign positional vertigo but given Rheumatology 's assessment that she has some asymmetric sensory abnormality , we will set her for an MRI scan of her brain and will be seen in the **INSTITUTION for 4 more vestibular function tests once we get some , I think , more important tests first .
The case was discussed in detail with house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
My note should be considered linked to theirs .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is doing okay today .
She states that she actually feels little bit better .
She has had a biopsy today .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She seems to have just some very mild proximal muscle weakness on her upper and lower extremities , but there was no distal extremity weakness , and she had some mild numbness in her feet bilaterally and on the lateral aspect of her left leg to light touch .
Her lungs revealed just a few crackles at the right base .
Her heart was regular .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
Increased sedimentation rate , white count , and CRP which is being worked up at this point for rheumatologic evaluation .
She had biopsies .
We will see what the biopsy results show .
We will get an EMG and nerve conduction study .
If her temporary biopsy is negative and her EMG is positive , then we would biopsy her leg ; and if that is negative , then consider bone marrow biopsy .
If her temporary biopsy is negative , we may be able to proceed with further evaluation as outpatient after her EMG nerve conduction tests .
Her case is discussed in detail with the house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
My note should be considered as linked .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient states that she continues to feel dizzy when she stands up .
She did hit her head she states when she passed out recently at home .
She states that her dizziness did start after that fall .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On her examination today , she had a few crackles at her right base .
Her heart was regular .
Abdomen was nontender .
Her strength was unchanged .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1 Temporal arteritis .
She had the temporal artery biopsies come back positive .
We will start her on steroid therapy 30 mg b.i.d.
We are going to discharge her home with close outpatient followup .
She will need to have a close followup to monitor her glucose given high doses of steroid therapy .
She is at approximately 40% risk of having hyperglycemia .
2 Anemia .
Anemia is likely of chronic disease .
She will likely improve .
She will be given iron therapy as well .
3 Vertigo .
We have set up to just be seen at the **INSTITUTION prior to discharge .
I think from our exam she likely has benign positional vertigo may be triggered by her fall .
Her case was discussed in detail with the house staff .
I agree with their note as written .
My note should be considered linked to theirs .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
As above .

ADMISSION DATE :

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Feb 19 07]
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
I have reviewed all the reports from the patient 's admission recently .
Basically , this is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old veteran in the **INSTITUTION with no significant past cardiac history .
The last echocardiogram in 2003 showed an EF of 55% , with chronic renal insufficiency , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , and history of stroke , who came into **INSTITUTION with 4 days of lightheadedness ; nausea ; poor appetite ; fatigue ; and two brief episodes of chest pain 4 days ago , left substernal , nonradiating , 5/10 , no associated symptoms , lasting for 2 minutes .
Denied any presyncopal episode .
Denied palpitations or shortness of breath .
Initially , went to the VA Emergency Department , and was found to be in a junctional rhythm and bradycardic .
The heart rate was in the 40s .
He was transferred to **INSTITUTION ED for further evaluation and was admitted to Pavilion Service for the treatment .
The patient was seen with Dr. **NAME[RRR] in the Pavilion Service and further treatment was undergone there and later on transferred to Medicine Service for further care and evaluation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , BPH , CRI , peripheral vascular disease , and history of CVA .
No history of CAD ; EF of 55% , but he smoked and quit 17 years back .
His EKG had showed sinus bradycardia alternating with junctional bradycardia .
MEDICATIONS :
He is on :
1. Atenolol .
2. Aspirin .
3. Felodipine .
4. Hydrochlorothiazide .
5. Zocor .
6. Allopurinol .
7. Terazosin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital Signs :
Stable .
His heart rate today was in the range of 70s after his beta blockers were stopped .
Blood pressure was 116/63 .
Nonhypoxic .
General :
Alert and oriented x3 .
No acute distress .
Lying comfortably .
HEENT :
Pupils were equal and reactive .
Lungs :
Some bibasilar crackles .
Cardiovascular :
Regular rate and rhythm .
No murmurs appreciated .
Extremities :
No edema .
IMPRESSION AND PLAN :
A **AGE[in 70s]- year - old with hypertension , CVA , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency admitted with bradycardia and acute on chronic kidney injury .
1. Cardiovascular .
Bradycardia is resolved after beta blockers and calcium channel blockers were stopped and Norvasc was started .
Continue Norvasc for now .
Blood pressure not well controlled .
Again , it will be really a narrow choice of the medications we can use on him presently .
I think we can start some kind of other calcium channel blockers which would have less effect on the AV junction node , like verapamil ; it could be a different choice .
Diuretics will not be good .
Beta blockers really made him bradycardic and ACE inhibitors would not be a good one with his renal failure .
So , we have a pretty narrow choice here .
I am going to start him on a low - dose of verapamil tonight .
2. Acute on chronic renal injury .
Creatinine is down to 4.2 , was up to 5.2 when he came in with just IV fluids .
It looks like he has a prerenal cause of all this .
Continue IV fluids .
Check on renal ultrasound and follow up creatinine closely .
The patient looks like he had decreased p.o. intake .
Again , I do not know what his baseline creatinine is like .
He could have a baseline high and increased creatinine .
He was given bicarbonate by the previous service , will continue it .
I do not think he needs to be continued when he is discharged .
3. Peripheral vascular disease .
Continue cilostazol .
4. Now regarding his cardiac issues , he did not get a stress test .
Cardiology did not think that he needed one .
It can be done as an outpatient in the **INSTITUTION .
SOCIAL ISSUES :
He came from home .
I need to assess the home situation and see whether he can go home once his creatinine is coming down and is back to normal , or whether we will need some kind of placement like __________ or not .
Total time spent on this patient was 40 minutes in coordination of care and looking over his chart .

Health Status
Summary of Hospitalization :
**AGE[in 70s] yo veteran with no significant cardiac history ( last echo 2003 with LVEF 55% ) , but with CRI , HTN , PVD , and h/o stroke ( 4 yrs. ago ) who presented **DATE[Feb 17 07] with 4 days of lightheadedness ( not vertigo ) , nausea ( no emesis ) , poor appetite , fatigue , and ~ 2 brief episodes of chest pain 4 days prior : L substernal , non-radiating , 5/10 , no associated symptoms , lasting ~ 2minutes .
Patient denied any pre - or syncopal episodes , denied palpitations , noted SOB only the morning of presentation while walking to the bathroom , denied recent fevers / chills .
Did report ongoing urinary incontinence and frequency , though no dysuria .
Initially presented to VA ED ( where he seeks all medical treatment ) , where he was found to be in a junctional rhythm .
First troponin was negative .
Transferred to the **INSTITUTION ED where vitals were :
T 36.7 , HR 40 ( still junctional ) , BP 122/61 , RR 18 ; was given ASA 81 mg x4 tabs , Nitro Paste 1 " and then admitted to the Cardiac Pavilion service .
Initial hospital course in the Cardiac Pavilion was as follows :
CVS
Within a few hrs. of admission , heart rate spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm , but continued to be bradycardic .
The bradycardia was thought to be due to medications in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure , so beta blocker ( atenolol ) was discontinued .
HCTZ was also discontinued due to elevated Cr .
For HTN patient was started on Norvasc 10 mg daily on 1/18 .
Troponins were negative x3 .
Systolic blood pressure was in the 150 's .
Renal
Admission Cr was 5.2 ( baseline 2.0-2.5 ) , showing acute on chronic renal insufficiency .
Urine lytes were suggestive of a pre-renal etiology ( consistent with recent decreased po intake ) , and IVF were initiated on 1/18 : NS @ 100 cc / hr .
Cr began to recover .
In addition , for metabolic acidosis , Na-bicarbonate was started on 1/18 ( low bicarb on admission ) .
On **DATE[Feb 19 07] patient was stable from a cardiac standpoint , Cr continued to improve with IVF , BP control was maintained with Norvasc , and the patient was transferred to the General Medicine A Service .
Hospital Course continued :
CVS
Blood pressure became quite high with systolic pressures in the 170s to 180s .
He was on a maximum dose of Norvasc , and hydralazine was added q.i.d. as well as a clonidine patch of 0.2 mg achieving systolic blood pressures of less than 140s .
On 1/22 tachycardia ( 100-110 ) was noted , but the patient continued to maintain good SaO2 on room air until 1/25 , at which time troponin was drawn and found to be elevated at 1.49 ( had been negative x3 on admission 1 week prior ).
The Cardiology consult service evaluated the patient and recommended giving a dosage of IV lasix x1 , holding IVF , start heparin empirically , and check TTE ( last assessment of LVEF was 55% in 2003 ) .
Decision was made to transfer patient back to Cardiac Pavilion for closer monitoring on telemetry .
Renal
NS IVF was continued until 1/23 and Cr continued to improve to around the baseline of 2.5 .
The renal U/S was done showing no hydronephrosis , and the right kidney measured 10.2 cm , while the left kidney measured 9.9 cm.
Na - bicarboante was continued throughout .
Respiratory
On 1/24 patient was notably tachypneic with SaO2 90-94% at rest , and also found to have significant edema of RUE at the site of earlier peripheral IV .
In the setting of tachypnea , tachycardia , decreased SaO2 , lowgrade fevers , and RUE edema , suspicion for a PE was high .
Bilateral upper extremity doppler study was negative for DVT and a CT scan of RUE showed dependent edema ; a VQ scan was obtained 1/24 with low probability for PE .
By 1/25 patient continued to have dyspnea and tachypnea at rest and required supplemental O2 , with SaO2 97% on 3L via nasal canula .
CXR was repeated and found to have no signs of infiltrate , and scant pulmonary congestion .
ID
Patient developed intermittent low - grade temperatures with no obvious etiology ; Tm 1/20 of 38 Tm 1/23 38.5 .
A CXR was done on 1/23 showing clear lungs with minimal fluid at the right base .
A U/A was done which was within normal limits ( nitrite , LE negative ; no bacteria ).
Urine and blood cultures from 1/23 were with no growth .
The patient denied any subjective symptoms such as chills , cough , or dysuria .
Again on 1/25 Tm was 38.1 .
Heme
Admission Hgb was 11.1 , and 1 week later it has trended down to 10.1 with a normal MCV .
Access
Left brachial PICC line placed 1/25 .
PM&amp ; R / PT / OT
Patient was assessed by PM&amp ; R service 1/21 who felt he did not need inpatient Rehab , and recommended a discharge to home with 24 - hr supervision with home PT / OT and nursing .
Prophylaxis / Diet

Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old gentleman who we were consulted and saw yesterday for kidney dysfunction .
We recommended that he be given some Lasix .
With the Lasix , he made about 2.5 liters of urine over 24 hours .
He feels considerably better today with less shortness of breath ; however , he did tell us that he had to sleep sitting up because he was afraid to lie down because of shortness of breath .
He seems to have no chest pain .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , he was in considerably less respiratory distress than yesterday , but he was certainly sitting up .
On examination of his lungs , he still has some rales at the bases bilaterally .
Rhythm is regular .
Abdomen is distended and nontender .
He continues to have considerable lower extremity edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory work was all inspected .
His creatinine today is 3.1 .
It was 3.0 yesterday .
BUN is 52 , 47 yesterday .
Potassium is 4.4 .
Hematocrit is 23.5 .
IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] appears to have considerable chronic kidney disease and has considerable volume overload .
I would continue with the Lasix 80 mg at least once a day , possibly b.i.d. , to get him out of congestive heart failure .
Perhaps some consideration should be given to giving him 1 unit of packed RBCs .
If you do this , I would suggest giving this with some additional IV Lasix .
The Renal Service will continue to follow him .
Thank you for this consult .

PGY - 1 OFF SERVICE NOTE
Summary of Hospitalization :
**AGE[in 70s] yo veteran with no significant cardiac history ( last echo 2003 with LVEF 55% ) , but with CRI , HTN , PVD , and h/o stroke ( 4 yrs. ago ) who presented
**DATE[Feb 17 07] with 4 days of lightheadedness ( not vertigo ) , nausea ( no emesis ) , poor appetite , fatigue , and ~ 2 brief episodes of chest pain 4 days prior :
L substernal , non-radiating , 5/10 , no associated symptoms , lasting ~ 2 minutes .
Patient denied any pre - or syncopal episodes , denied palpitations , noted SOB only the morning of presentation while walking to the bathroom , denied recent fevers /chills .
Did report ongoing urinary incontinence and frequency , though no dysuria .
Initially presented to VA ED ( where he seeks all medical treatment ) , where he was found to be in a junctional rhythm .
First troponin was negative .
Transferred to the **INSTITUTION ED where vitals were :
T 36.7 , HR 40 ( still junctional ) , BP 122/61 , RR 18 ; was given ASA 81 mg x4 tabs , Nitro Paste 1 " and then admitted to the Cardiac Pavilion service .
Initial hospital course in the Cardiac Pavilion was as follows :
CVS
Within a few hrs. of admission , heart rate spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm , but continued to be bradycardic .
The bradycardia was thought to be due to medications in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure , so beta blocker ( atenolol ) was discontinued .
HCTZ was also discontinued due to elevated Cr .
For HTN patient was started on Norvasc 10 mg daily on 1/18 .
Troponins were negative x3 .
Systolic blood pressure was in the 150 's .
Renal
Admission Cr was 5.2 ( baseline 2.0 - 2.5 ) , showing acute on chronic renal insufficiency .
Urine lytes were suggestive of a pre - renal etiology ( consistent with recent decreased po intake ) , and IVF were initiated on 1/18 : NS @ 100 cc / hr .
Cr began to recover .
In addition , for metabolic acidosis , Na - bicarbonate was started on 1/18 ( low bicarb on admission ) .
On **DATE[Feb 19 07] patient was stable from a cardiac standpoint , Cr continued to improve with IVF , BP control was maintained with Norvasc , and the patient was transferred to the General Medicine A Service .
Hospital Course continued :
CVS
Blood pressure became quite high with systolic pressures in the 170s to 180s .
He was on a maximum dose of Norvasc , and hydralazine was added q.i.d. as well as a clonidine patch of 0.2 mg achieving systolic blood pressures of less than 140s .
On 1/22 tachycardia ( 100-110 ) was noted , but the patient continued to maintain good SaO2 on room air until 1/25 , at which time troponin was drawn and found to be elevated at 1.49 ( had been negative x3 on admission 1 week prior ).
The Cardiology consult service evaluated the patient and recommended giving a dosage of IV lasix x1 , holding IVF , start heparin empirically , and check TTE ( last assessment of LVEF was 55% in 2003 ) .
Decision was made to transfer patient back to Cardiac Pavilion for closer monitoring on telemetry .
Renal
NS IVF was continued until 1/23 and Cr continued to improve to around the baseline of 2.5 .
The renal U/S was done showing no hydronephrosis , and the right kidney measured 10.2 cm , while the left kidney measured 9.9 cm .
Na - bicarboante was continued throughout .
Respiratory
On 1/24 patient was notably tachypneic with SaO2 90-94% at rest , and also found to have significant edema of RUE at the site of earlier peripheral IV .
In the setting of tachypnea , tachycardia , decreased SaO2 , lowgrade fevers , and RUE edema , suspicion for a PE was high .
Bilateral upper extremity doppler study was negative for DVT and a CT scan of RUE showed dependent edema ; a VQ scan was obtained 1/24 with low probability for PE .
By 1/25 patient continued to have dyspnea and tachypnea at rest and required supplemental O2 , with SaO2 97% on 3L via nasal canula .
CXR was repeated and found to have no signs of infiltrate , and scant pulmonary congestion .
ID
Patient developed intermittent low - grade temperatures with no obvious etiology ; Tm 1/20 of 38 Tm 1/23 38.5 .
A CXR was done on 1/23 showing clear lungs with minimal fluid at the right base .
A U/A was done which was within normal limits ( nitrite , LE negative; no bacteria ).
Urine and blood cultures from 1/23 were with no growth .
The patient denied any subjective symptoms such as chills , cough , or dysuria .
Again on 1/25 Tm was 38.1 .
Heme
Admission Hgb was 11.1 , and 1 week later it has trended down to 10.1 with a normal MCV .
Access
Left brachial PICC line placed 1/25 .
PM&amp ; R / PT / OT
Patient was assessed by PM&amp ; R service 1/21 who felt he did not need inpatient Rehab , and recommended a discharge to home with 24 - hr supervision with home PT / OT and nursing .
Prophylaxis / Diet
Maintained on colace , senna , and H2 blocker .
Renal / cardiac diet .
Upon transfer to Pavilion 1/25 :
Assessment and Plan :
**AGE[in 70s] yo WM who presented initially **DATE[Feb 18 07] with symptomatic junctional bradycardia and acute on chronic renal insufficiency .
Since then he has developed tachycardia , tachypnea , and a new O2 requirement , but no new EKG changes .
CVS
a ) r/o ACS
- cardiac enzymes trended down - ischemia likely due to fluid overload
- repeat EKG with no new changes
- continue ASA and zocor
b ) evaluate for Left heart failure

CT due to renal insuffcy. and IV contrast
b ) poor aeration , though no documented h/o pulm disease
- tried xopenex / atrovent nebulizer effective
- most likely due to diastolic dysfxn and pulm interstitial edema and pl effusions
- therapeutic L sided thoracentesis done 1/30 , with removal of 80 cc fluid , sent to lab ( pending )

Plan
Disposition
1. Sinusitis
- on Day 3 of Zithromax .
Feeling better today .
- congestion loosening .
Pt coughing more as a result
2. s/p Fall
- main concern at this time is patient safety at home
- would favor more aggressive PT with a possible evaluation for acute rehab .
Pt would benefit from acute rehab
3. Borderline Tacchycardia
- pt 's HR fluctuating between high 90 's and high 110 's
- no evidence for acute cause such as sepsis , DVT / PE , CVA , A-fib , or orthostasis
- would recheck orthostatics today , including an assessment of HR during this measurement
- Etiology at this point likely the fact that the pt has not been taking her Lopressor for 6 months
- if orthostatics negative , may favor increasing Lopressor to 50 BID
4. DM ( 141 , 170 , 124 , 163 )
- HgBA1C = 6.2 -- Excellent
- pt started on Actos 15 Daily yesterday .
No problems with tolerance yet .
- In light of prior non-compliance and excellent A1C , may even favor decreasing Actos to 7.5 mg Daily
5. HTN
- on prinizide 12.5 / 20 and metoprolol 25 BID currently
- BP slightly higher today than yesterday .
If orthostatics negative , may favor increasing Lopressor to 50 BID
6. Hyperlipidemia
- on lipitor 10 mg currently .
Lipid panel pending
7. CAD
- stable on ASA
8. Placement
- pt safety is the main concern at this point .
- would favor more aggressive PT / OT today .
Pt has not ambulated since admission
- pt would benefit from acute rehab / gait training / home safety evaluation .
Would consider evaluation to see if pt qualifies for inpatient rehab on 4A
Addendum by **NAME[XXX , WWW] on **DATE[Jun 04 2007] 10:41 AM
Pt was seen and examed by me .
Case discussed with medical student of **NAME[CCC VVV].
Agree with the plan of above .
- recheck orthostatic BP + HR , if neg. increase b-block to 50 bid for her hr controlled .
- Waiting for sw and pt final report .
trying to move her to acute reh. in 4A .

His hemoglobin was 10.7 .
His chemistries were within normal limits .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
This is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old gentleman with history of chronic granulomatous disease who has stable pyogenic liver abscess and was admitted a week ago for pneumonia that was thought to be __________ .
BAL was supposed to be done and has not been arranged for .
The patient now returns with fever , malaise , chills , and rigors .
At this point in time , I am going to focus on lowering his temperature using acetaminophen orally and per rectum .
I would consider Demerol if needed .
We spoke with the Infectious Disease Service .
They are going to see the patient urgently .
I think that the patient is septic , however , I am not sure if its bacterial , and there is no role of empiric antibiotics at this point in time .
I am going to continue the itraconazole established by the ID Service previously .
Given the absence of peritoneal signs , I am not keen on scanning his abdomen urgently .
However , we did discuss with the Infectious Disease possible imaging , and they asked us to wait until they see the patient .
Cultures were sent .
We made sure that they are in the lab .
We also contacted Pulmonary Service to see the patient for BAL and the evaluation for pneumonia .
I did discuss this plan with the patient and his mother .

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Jun 01 07]
SUBJECTIVE :
This patient states he is still having some abdominal pain , although it is mildly improved today as well as his feeling of gas pains .
He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath .
He has been eating well and has been urinating without difficulty .
He denied any fevers , any chills or sweats , although he did have a fever overnight .
OBJECTIVE :
Vital Signs :
Temperature is 36.7 , pulse 84 , respiratory rate 18 , and blood pressure 120/82 .
General :
He is awake .
He is alert and in no acute distress .
HEENT :
He has moist mucous membranes .
His heart is regular rate and rhythm .
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally .
No wheezes or crackles .
Abdomen :
Soft .
He has positive bowel sounds .
He has no rebound or guarding , although he does have some tenderness diffusely with deep palpation .
Extremities are warm and well perfused .
No clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .
Skin :
He has no visible rash .
His mood is stable .
LAB WORK :
He had a colonoscopy this afternoon , which showed normal terminal ileum , normal colonoscopy status post biopsy __________ .
He had an INR of 1.5 , white count of 2.9 , and H and H 9.9/29.6 with platelets of 141 .
Sodium 139 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN and creatinine 11/1.6 , albumin 3.6 , total bilirubin 0.1 , ALT 97 , AST 41 , alkaline phosphatase 85 , and GGTP 65 .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
1. Fever .
He is currently on Zosyn and vancomycin on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .
He is being followed by the ID Service .
We had a long discussion with them .
There is no clear origin of his fevers at this point .
It could be secondary to his underlying disease although this is a diagnosis of exclusion .
At this point , we will redo some blood cultures from both his PICC line and from his blood today .
If his cultures are negative , we can assume that it is a possibility that his underlying disease is causing his fevers .
His regular Infectious Disease physician , Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] who will be coming back in town tomorrow and will likely discuss his case with her .
2. GI .
He has had persistent gas - like abdominal pain .
We will have the GI Service see him as well as the GI Surgery Service who felt that a colonoscopy might be warranted to make sure that he did not have any evidence of disease in his colon .
Therefore , he was prepped last night with GoLYTELY and had a colonoscopy which is as noted above .
Given the fact that he has mildly improving symptoms , plan will be to continue with his current medicines and diet , we will hold off on giving him steroids for now .
3. DVT , left upper extremity .
He is currently on Coumadin and his INR is 1.5 .
I will give him 3 mg of Coumadin tonight and continue with his heparin drip .
4. Acute renal failure .
His INR was 1.6 today , which has been stable for the last few days .
The Renal Service has been following , and they feel that it could be likely secondary to the high - dose spectrum he was getting .
This has been discontinued , and we will continue to follow .

Brief Hospital Course:
INITIAL IMPRESSION :
90 year-old woman with h/o of HTN p/w substernal chest pain shortly after exercise at nursing home , with EKG showing ST depressions in V1-V4 and troponin 0.07.
Likely NSTEMI .
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
.
* CV :
The patient 's family refused coronary artery catheterization .
The patient was given ASA , Plavix , heparin drip x 24 hours , nitro drip , atorvastatin , metoprolol , and lisinopril .
Her chest pain was controlled with morphine .
Her SBP remained in the 160s-170s on hospital day 1 and she was gently diuresed .
On hospital day 2 she experienced atrial fibrillation with HR in the 140s .
Her metoprolol dose was increased from 25 mg PO bid to 50 mg PO bid then 75 mg PO tid .
Her HR decreased to 70s-80s .
Her BP remained stable .
An ECHO showed that she had preserved EF and no wall motion abnormalities .
We decided given her age that she would not be a good candidate for cardioversion for her afib nor would she be a good candidate for coumadin .
Therefore we will continue rate control with metoprolol this can be titrated if needed , and aspirin and plavix for anti-coagulation .
She should also continue on lipitor and lisinopril .
She should have her chem 7 checked next week given the start of her new meds .
Will also need LFT 's checked in 3-6 months .
.
* Pulmonary :
Bilateral crackles at bases and midlungs , elevated JVP , trace bilateral ankle edema , and CXR with diffuse opacities suggest possible pulmonary edema , likely secondary to acute MI .
Her O2 sat was stable at 94-97% on 2.5L of supplemental O2 .
She experienced no respiratory difficulty during the hospital stay .
She was diuresed small amount .
Her CXR prior to discharge showed mild pulm edema and thus was given 40 of lasix prior to going to rehab .
She can be given prn lasix for weight gain or shortness of breath .
.
* Leukocytosis- She developed mild elevated WBC .
UA had 12-14
WBC 's , few bacteria .
She was initially started on Bactrim , but this was stopped as she was afebrile .
SHe has a culture pending which needs to be followed up at the nursing home and treated if positive .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Wisniewski is a 45-year-old woman with multiple familial cavernous hemangiomas .
She is right-handed .
She was in her usual state of health until one and a half weeks prior to admission .
She developed an ear ache , for which she saw her primary care physician , Evelyn was prescribed cortisone drops .
A few days later she complained of dizziness .
This was mostly described as feeling unsteady on her feet .
She stated that she had trouble knowing if her feet were touching the ground .
She was seen again by primary care physician , Roderick since she had complaints of dizziness , as well as a new complaint of decreased hearing and the sensation of static in her ears , meniere 's disease was considered .
She was given an oral prednisone taper .
This unsteady gait progressed , and then she subsequently started to develop a pins and needle feeling in the face , hands and feet bilaterally .
Her hearing got progressively worse and the sound of static increased .
She was very fatigued .
At an outside hospital , head CT revealed a 1.5 cm diameter hyperdense mass in the pons , slightly off center to the right .
She was transferred here for further care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for multiple cavernous hemangiomas .
She has had at least two bleeding episodes in the past , mostly described as being accompanied by generalized weakness .
She has had at least two generalized seizures in the past , but she has not had one since she was 26 years old .
She was never on an anticonvulsant due to her former beliefs as N. Derk Scientist .
She no longer observes that belief system .
MEDICATIONS :
Prednisone taper as above .
ALLERGIES :
None .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Strong maternal history of hemangiomas .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature 99.2 .
Pulse 60 .
Blood pressure 120/80 .
Respiratory rate 14 .
In general , she was a thin well-appearing woman in no acute distress .
Sclera were anicteric .
Neck was supple .
Chest was clear .
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen soft , nontender and distended .
Extremities showed no edema .
Neurologically , she was awoken from sleep by voice , cooperative , but mildly drowsy .
She became more alert during the remainder of the exam .
Speech was fluent but slow , and there was long response latencies before she would initiate speech .
She otherwise had normal spontaneous movements and facial expression and did not appear to be abulic .
She had normal comprehension .
She was able to give a detailed history in an organized manner .
There was no dysarthria .
Language was normal .
There was no evidence of any special neglect .
Pupils equal , round and reactive to light .
Visual fields were full .
Extraocular movements were full with normal smooth pursuit to the left .
Pursuit was interrupted by >.....< when tracking from left to right .
She had sustained gaze holding nystagmus in both horizontal directions .
There was no rotary component .
She had a mildly widened right palpable fissure .
There was decreased excursion of the right mouth and flattening of the right nasolabial fold ( mild ) .
Light touch was subjectively abnormal on both sides of the face .
Hearing was diminished for conversational speech .
Palate and tongue moved normally in the midline .
There was a mild left pronator drift .
Finger tapping and rapid alternating movements were slow on the left and she had trouble isolating individual finger movements .
There was mild finger-to-nose dysmetria on the left .
Power was mildly diminished in the finger extensors and hand intrinsics on the left , otherwise , power was full throughout .
Reflexes were brisk in the legs with 4-5 beats of clonus at the ankles bilaterally .
She had bilateral upgoing toes .
She made mistakes with position sense , roughly at chance level with both great toes and the left first finger , position sense in the right limb seems preserved .
Gait was wide based , very unsteady , veering to the left and to the right .
She retropulsed and would have pitched backwards without the assistance of the examiner .
LABORATORIES :
White blood cell count 7.8 with 86% polymorphonuclear cells , 11.1 lymphocytes , hemoglobin 14.3 , hematocrit 40.5 , MCV 88 , INR 1.0 , PTT 24.7 , PT 12.3 , platelet count 295,000 , glucose 81 , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.8 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 104 , CO2 26 , calcium 9.3 , phosphate 4.8 , magnesium 2.3 .
MRI of the brain revealed multiple foci susceptibility artifact within the brain .
These were seen best in gradient echocardiogram images .
There was a large focus of subacute blood products in the mid to low pons suggesting recent hemorrhage into a cavernous angioma .
There was some mild surrounding edema .
There are also tiny foci artifact within the cerebellum and base of the pons .
There was a larger area of susceptibility artifact in the left temporal lobe , right frontal lobe , and the splenius of the corpus collasum .
The brain parenchyma was otherwise normal .
There was mild enhancement of the pontine hemorrhagic mass but none elsewhere .
There was no areas of restricted diffusion to indicate infarction .
MRA of the brain was unremarkable .
There was no communication >.......< in the visualized vessels and the angiomas .
Follow-up CT was obtained the second day of admission .
There was no evidence of developing hydrocephalus , which was a concern due to the surrounding edema , and possible suppression of the fourth ventricle .
There was no significant change in size of the subacute pontine hemorrhage .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mrs. Wisniewski is a 45 - year-old woman with a strong family history of cavernous angiomas .
She has had several prior bleeding events and presented with a subacute bleed in the mid to lower pons .
There was relatively central in location , with only a slight right-sided predominance .
Her physical examination remained relatively unchanged , with resolution of the subtle left hand weakness and right facial weakness .
Her gait remained severely ataxic , likely secondary to sensory deafferentation , as well as involvement of crossing pontine cerebellar fibers .
Therefore , it was recommended that she have aggressive Physical Therapy at an Acute Rehabilitation Center .
The case was discussed with Dr. Harold from the Falmouth Hospital .
He has followed this family in the past and will see her in follow-up .
We will arrange to have a copy of the MRI scans sent to him .

Chief Complaint :
Chest Pain
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Removal of tunneled cath ( previously used for tPN )
History of Present Illness :
54 yo F with Crohn 's s/p ileostomy and subsequent short gut syndrome with port-a-cath placement for TPN who presents with progressive right sided chest pain that comes in waves .
The pt reports sharp 10/10 chest pain under the right breast which is getting progressively worse .
The pain is worsened with deep inspiration or movement .
It initially started one day previously but has gotten significantly worse over last 12 hours .
It is associated with SOB as well as fevers , chills .
The pt denies abd pain , n/v or increased ostomy output .
Given her fever , sx of chest pain and SOB as well as an elevated WBC count , she was initially thought to have a PNA .
She was therefore given ceftriaxone 1 g IV x1 and azithromycin 500 mg PO x1 in the Deanna .
As the CXR was without any evidence of PNA , or PTX , the pt subsequently received a CTA to evaluate for PE which revealed multifocal bilateral PNA but no PE .
At this time , she was given Vancomycin 1 g IV x1 .
She was also given morphine 2 mg x3 , 4 mg IV x2 , dolasetron 12.5 mg x2 and ativan 1 mg IV x1 .
Past Medical History :
1. Crohn 's disease , dx 1974 s/p three bowel resections and eventual ileostomy , resulting in short gut syndrome

Brief Hospital Course :
54 yo F with Crohn 's disease s/p ileostomy with subsequent short gut syndrome with port-o-cath for TPN presents with acute onset pleuritic chest pain with fever , chills , and sob .
1. Chest pain / Fever / Chills :
The acute onset of chest pain was initially very concerning for a PE , however the Chest CT demonstrated multifocal consolidation consistent with a bacterial PNA .
This is consistent with the remainder of the pt 's history including fever , chills , sob and an elevated WBC count .
The pt was given ceftriaxone / azithromycin / vancomycin in Deanna .
Blood , urine and sputum culutres were sent .
Pt 's blood cultures came back positive for Staph Aureus and Enterococcus , both were pansensitive .
Sputum culture also returned with Staph. Aureus .
Ceftriaxone and azithro were discontinued , and Vacomycin was continued .
Pt initially was hypoxic requiring NRB for O2 sat of 94% , with any attempt to wean she would desat .
Pt was intubated prior to tunneled catheter removal , see below .
( The tunneled catheter later came back for negative for culture. )
Earlier that day pt had a chest x ray which showed diffuse infiltrative process concerning for ARDS .
Post procedure pt remained intubated on ARDSnet protocol .
She self extubated the first day and was reintubated without any complications .
Her O2 requirement improved on the vent over the next few days and she was weaned off the vent on 2013-01-01 .
After extubation her o2 requirement was down to 1L NC with sats in mid 90s .
She was transferred to the floor for further managment .
The patient remained afebrile when she transferred to the medicine service .
She was weaned off the oxygen and for the remainder of her course her O2sats were stable on room air .
The patient had completed her antibiotic course while in house .
2. Hx of multiple port-o-cath clots :
Although the pt is on warfarin chronically , her INR was subtherapeutic .
Goal INR 01-31 .
Initially coumadin was increased , however given concern for infected line , general surgery was consulted who removed the line in the ICU .
3. ARF :
Pt initially with mild ARI , this was thought to be due to dehydration , after initial volume repletion her renal function improved to her baseline .
4. CMED :
The pt has a history of paranoia / depression .
ON admission she was taking Quetiapine 300 mg QHS and Clonazepam 1 mg QAM , 1 mg Q3PM , 2 mg PO QHS .
Quetiapine was continued however clonipin was initially held when she was intubated on fentynyl / versed .
This was restarted post extubation .
Intially after being transferred from the ICU to the medicine service the patient was mentating appropriately .
Her course later became complicated by visual and auditory hallucinations .
She made disturbing comments to the hospital personnel .
She was unable to sleep at night , often pacing the halls .
She required a 1:1 sitter .
Psychiatry was consulted .
They felt that her presentation was secondary to delirium and was multifactorial .
They attributed it to polypharmacy , recent infection ( pneumonia ) and insomnia .
A head CT was done which ruled out any acute processes .
The patient refused an LP .
They made recommendations for adjustments to her anti-psychotic medications .
At discharge the patient was on clonazepam 1 mg tid , seroquel 300 BID and neurontin 600 QAM , 1200 QPM and 1200 QHS .
The Kindred Hospital hospital course was prolonged because of her delirium .
Once her mental status improved she was discharged .
5. ? Parkinson 's Disease / Akithesia :
The patient was maintained Sinemet .
6. Pain :
In addition to her usual neuropathy pain , the pt initially appeared to have significant pain from the multi-focal PNA as well .
( Home regimen , Gabapentin 800 mg PO QAM , 1600 mg PO Q3PM , 1600 mg PO QHS .
This was held in the ICU and she was given diluadid prn for pain control .
The patient 's narcotic and CMED CCU regimen was evaluated by psychiatry during her delirium .
Please see above for their recommendations .
7. FEN :
Given her hx of ileostomy secondary to crohn 's disease and resultant short gut syndrome , the pt requires nutritional support via TPN .
After removal of tunneled line pt was given tube feeds while she was intubated .
The patient was transitioned to a low fat , low residue diet .

Imaging Studies :
1. CXR ( PA/Lateral ) 2017-09-03
Congestive heart failure with bilateral effusions ( R > L ) , with possible underlying consolidation in the RLL and to a lesser degree the RML and LLL .
2. CXR 2017-09-04
Compared to PA and lateral chest of the prior day .
Right-sided PICC line with its tip in the distal SVC .
The heart is markedly enlarged .
There remains a large right and small left pleural effusion , not significantly changed .
Patient remains in congestive heart failure , though it may be slightly improved compared to the prior study .
Underlying infectious consolidation in the right lower lobe not excluded .
3. Echo 2017-09-04
The left atrium is mildly dilated .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy .
The left ventricular cavity size is normal .
LV systolic function appears depressed .
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .
Right ventricular chamber size is normal and free wall motion may be mildly impaired .
The aortic root is mildly dilated .
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated .
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present .
The aortic prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally .
The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis .
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality , with elevated left atrial pressure .
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV ( severe ) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction .
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
There is no pericardial effusion .
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of 2017-08-14 , ventricular function is now similar.
EF 35-40% .
4. Echo 2017-09-14
The left atrium is mildly dilated .
The left ventricular cavity size is normal .
Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed .
3l .
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened .
There is no pericardial effusion .
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of 2017-09-04 , there is probably no significant change .
All cultures , including BCx , UCx , pleural fluid culture , and wound culture have been negative .
5. CT Chest 2017-09-16 :
1. Increasing large right-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary edema .
Scattered parenchymal opacities in the left lower lobe represent superimposed infection vs atelectasis .
There is no evidence of abscess .
6. 2017-09-28 Chest X Ray :
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST .
There has been almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema .
A small right pleural effusion has decreased in size .
Mild cardiomegaly is stable .
There is no pneumothorax .
Right PIC catheter tip ends in the lower SVC .
Patient is post median sternotomy .
IMPRESSION :
Almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema .
7. 2017-09-29 CT Head :
FINDINGS :
There is no evidence of intraaxial or extraaxial hemorrhage , mass effect , shift of normally midline structures , or acute major or minor vascular territorial infarction .
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent , but stable in size and appearance .
The gray-white matter differentiation is preserved .
Again seen are subtle hypodensities within the periventricular white matter which is an indication of chronic microvascular ischemic changes , stable .
Extensive carotid artery calcifications are identified .
The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear .
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable .
IMPRESSION :
No evidence of acute or chronic infarction .
Stable microvascular ischemic changes in the periventricular white matter .
8. 2017-09-30 EEG :
IMPRESSION :
Abnormal EEG due to the moderately slow posterior background and occasional bursts of generalized slowing .
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and subcortical structures .
Medications , metabolic disturbances , and infection are among the most common causes .
No prominent focal abnormalities were evident , and there were no epileptiform features .
The cardiac monitor showed occasional irregularities in a PACED rhythm .
Brief Hospital Course :

He continued to diurese and he was moved to the floor since he no longer required intensive level care .
While on the floor , he continued to be diuresed .
After several days , he became hypotensive and triggered for BPs 60s/30s .
He was given IVF without an adequate response in his pressures .
He was transferred back to the CCU and started on a dopamine gtt .
He diuresed well on the dopamine gtt and his BP was supported .
Gradually , the dopamine gtt was weaned .
However , he still appeared volume overloaded with minimal improvement in his oxygen requirement .
A swan was placed for a more accurate picture of his volume status and he was volume overloaded by swan numbers with an elevated PAD and elevated CVP without an obtainable wedge pressure .
He also had a high CO and low SVR suggestive of sepsis , but he never had an elevated WBC and was afebrile during his entire hospital admission with negative blood , urine , wound , and pleural fluid cultures .
The Lasix drip was eventually changed to IV Lasix boluses , with a net diuresis of over 36 liters for the hospital stay .
He was then transitioned to oral Lasix for maintainence .
The patient had an echo on 2017-09-04 with the results above in detail .
It was unchanged in comparison to 2017-08-14 with similar ventricular function and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .
The patient had another echo on 2017-09-14 with no new changes .
At discharge the patient was thought to be euvolemic , satting well on room air and without peripheral edema .
His dry weight is 70.4 kg .
Ischemia
The patient had an initial troponin bump on admission which was most likely secondary to CHF exacerbation .
He was continued on Aspirin , Metoprolol and Lipitor with no further issues .
Rhythm
The patient is completely pacer-dependent , being epicardially paced at 70 .
He is on Amiodarone for post-op afib and this was continued this entire admission .
His underlying rhythm is atrial flutter ; it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted .
Anti-coagulation was started with Warfarin 5 mg with a goal of 2-3 and a plan for cardioversion in 6 weeks .
The patient 's INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held .
His coumadin was transitioned to 2 mg and then 1 mg .
His INR continued to flucuate .
He was discharged on 1 mg , but a stable regimen had not been achieved .
His INR will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable .
His INR goal is 02-24 .
2# SOB on admission :
Likely due to CHF exacerbation , with diuresis of over 36 L during his admission .
He had 4 surgeries ( 3 cardiac surgeries ) earlier in the summer , so it is likely that he required copious IVF hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload .
It appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non-compliance at rehab , per previous discharge summaries .
On discharge , the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as PRN nebs and INH COPD meds .
3# Metabolic Alkalosis / Hypochloremia :
Etiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and / or post-hypercapnia .
This acutely worsened on 2017-09-18 , when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an ABG revealed a CO2 of over 100 , likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis .
The patient was therefore intubated for ventilation , and continued to be diuresed .
His CO2 improved and he was extubated after a few days .
All sedating medications were held and serial ABGs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis .
4# Pleural effusions : s/p right thoracentesis on 2017-09-06 , 1600 mL of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space .
Gram stain and cultures were negative , cytology was negative .
The right pleural effusion slowly re-accumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis .
Repeat CXR showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications
5# T2DM :
The patient was started on Glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale .
He was monitored with QID fingersticks .
His blood sugars were in the 100s on discharge .
6# Hyperlipidemia :
The patient was continued on his statin .
7# COPD :
The patient was continued on nebs
8# MS changes :
The patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities .
His mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above .
Neurology was also consulted and a head CT showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status .
An EEG showed mild encephalopathy , but no other findings .
His mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose ; he was discharged on this medication .
9# Hypothyroidism :
The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Levothyroxine .
10# ? UTI :
The patient was started on levofloxacin at Newton-Wellesley Hospital for a question of UTI based on U/A positive for WBC .
UCx during this hospitalization were negative and Levofloxacin was d/c 'd .
11# Chronic lower back pain :
The patient was treated with a Lidocaine patch and Percocet prn .
Stronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and MS changes .
12# Wound Care :
The patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer .
Wound care was consulted on 2017-09-05 and they made several recommendations .
For the left gluteal pressure ulcer , they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner , thin layer of Duoderm gel , air dry , allevyn foam adhesive over the site , and change every 2 days or prn .
For the left chest wound , they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser , pat dry , pack aquacel AG rope and moisten with saline , cover with dry gauze and change daily .
These recommendations were followed throughout the admission .
13# Voiding :
Pt. failed multiple attempts to void on his own .
Case was discussed with neurology .
He was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission .
He is scheduled to follow up with urology to address this issue .
Until then , his foley should remain in place .
14# Code :
The patient was full code during admission .

IMAGING :
2017-08-14 CXR :
ETT in correct position .
PM wires in good position .
S/p right pneumonectomy .
Blunting of left CPA likely effusion .
New lower left lateral CW opacity , likely loculated pleural fluid .
2017-07-19 ECHO :
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum .
LVEF 25% .
Resting WMA include mid to distal septal akinesis , apical akinesis , inferior akinesis/hypokinesis , and mid to distal anterolateral hypokinesis / akinesis .
No definite apical thrombus seen ( cannot exclude ).
01-22+ AR .
Trivial MR .
1+ TR .
2017-08-16 CT head :
New rounded low-density area measuring 2.5 cm in left basal ganglia , which partially extends to the left thalamus , probably representing subacute infarction .
On this head CT without contrast , the evaluation is limited .
2017-08-16 CTA chest :
No evidence for pulmonary embolism .
Findings consistent with failure or fluid overload .
Development of small loculated pleural fluid collection along the periphery of the left major fissure or so-called pseudotumor , consistent with the recent chest x-ray .
Unchanged appearance of right pneumonectomy .
2017-08-16 ECHO :
The left atrium is normal in size .
Overall LVEF is difficult to assess due to poor echo windows although the basal LV appeas hyperdynamic without regional contraction abnormality ( suspect significant improvement compared to prior study dated 2017-07-18 ).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle ( due to poor echo windows cannot fully exclude ).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated .
There is no aortic valve stenosis .
Mild ( 1+ ) aortic regurgitation is seen .
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen .
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation .
There is a small pericardial effusion .
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade
2017-08-17 EEG :
Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the voltage suppression over the left hemisphere and due to the bursts of generalized slowing and right hemisphere slowing .
The first abnormality raises the possibility of material ( such as subdural fluid ) interposed between the brain and recording electrodes or widespread cortical dysfunction on that side .
Anatomic correlation would be of interest if clinically indicated .
The generalized slowing indicates a non specific dysfunction in midline structures .
There was also evidence of subcortical dysfunction on the right side .
No epileptiform features were seen .

Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Lockley was admitted with respiratory failure , thought to be related to mucus plugging as well as a pseudomonal pneumonia .
Both of these etiologies were treated , and he continued to oxygenate and ventilate well on his usual ventilator settings .
However , the issue that dominated the admission was his recent acute decline in mental status .
He was thoroughly evaluated by neurology and underwent head CT , MRI , LP , and EEG .
This work-up demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct , likely cardioembolic .
However , they felt this event could not account for his new , severe global deficit ; this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process , likely anoxic encephalopathy , for which the prognosis is extremely grim .
This was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient 's wife , son , primary care doctor , ICU attending , and neurology consultant in the presence of a Asian interpreter .
The end result of these discussion was that the patient 's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery ; the family decided to make him comfort measures only .
He was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped , and he expired shortly thereafter .
The family was present .

Chief Complaint : fever
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Intubation for airway protection tunneled line change over wire 2019-01-08
History of Present Illness :
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD , type 2 DM , and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the Juan with sepsis of unknown etiology .
Pt was recently admitted to The Hospital for Orthopedics from 12-07 thorugh 12-14 with hypotension thought to be secondary to overdiuresis at HD.
However , a septic component to the hypotension was also considered as the pt was found to have citrobacter in her urine and C diff in her stool .
Pt was then discharged to Arbour-Fuller Hospital Senior Life where she was in her normal state of health until three days ago .
Her son reports that she then developed a headache and fevers started three days ago which were treated with tylenol .
Then , this morning she developed fatigue and did not eat well .
He son also notes that she appeared to be working hard to breath .
She was found to be febrile to 101.9 and received levoflox and vancomycin .
Pt was then sent to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Juan for further evaluation .
Per notes , pt denied SOB , CP , and abdominal pain prior to intubation .
She did complain of a left frontal headache .
In the Juan , the pt 's VS were singificant for a fever of 103.8 , tachycardia in the 130s-150s , and initial hypertensive in the 140s .
Her oxygen saturation was 96% on RA but she was tachypneic to 31 .
She was obtunded and was thus intubated for airway protection .
Post-intubation , the pt 's BP acutely dropped to 58/19 in the setting of propofol .
When this medication was discontinued , her BP came back up to the 70s-90s / 30s-50s .
Pt was then initiated on the sepsis protocol .
In the Juan , she received vancomycin , levofloxacin , flagyl , and cefepime ( 2 gm ).
She received a total of 4 liters of NS then was started on levophed for continued hypotension .
Pt is now transferred to the FICU for further care .
Per pt 's son , she is bedbound at baseline due to her multiple LE femur fractures .
Past Medical History :
1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
2. Diabetic nephropathy resulting in ESRD for which she is on HD .
Pt was due for HD but missed it secondary to her illness .
She normally receives HD on Mon , Wed , and Fri .
3. Status post left femur fracture
4. Hyponatremia
5. Hypercholesterolemia
6. Unsteady gait
7. Cataracts
8. Back pain
9. Hypertension
10. Anemia of chronic disease
11. S/P L shoulder hemiarthroplasty following a left humeral fracuture in 2018-11-10- Dumas was complicated by a PEA arrest secondary to PE .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD , type 2 DM , and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the Juan with sepsis of unknown etiology .
1. Sepsis / ID- Started on sepsis protocol .
Unclear etiology headache over the three days prior to admission in association with fever was concerning for a CNS etiology .
Covered broadly with vancomycin , flagyl , and cefipime .
Given stress dose steroids empirically and Sanchez stim showed cortisol of 9.3 --> 10.3 therefore steroids continued .
CXR , LP , UA and abdominal CT showed no sign of infection .
PICC line was removed empirically .
Tip could not be cultured due to contamination .
Cultures drawn off the HD cath are negative to date .
Patient 's LE ulcers appear chronic and do not appear to be the source of infection .
Her left knee is slightly erythematous compared to the right but not impressive .
Joint is mobile .
Nasal washings for influenza were negative ; culture pending .
Patient improved over the next few days .
Steroids were discontinued .
On 12-18 flagyl and cefepime were discontinued as all culture data negative to date .
Plan to continue vancomycin for 08-19 day course to treat empiric line infection .
Urine culture came back positive for VRE , however , since patient improved without treatement ( ie Linezolid ) initially .
After transfer to the floor when she was stable .
On the floor the Vancomycin was discontinued as the catheter tip culture was negative .
ID was consulted who suggested broad spectrum antibiotics if she were to spike .
When pt spiked a temperature and became hypotensive she was started on Linezolid was started for presumed VRE infection in the urine .
She will be treated for total 14 day course .
She was also started on fluconazole for yeast in the urine , to be treated with fluconazole for total 7 days .
She was given Flagyl for presumed C. Diff. Colitis , however this was stopped when C. Diff B toxin came back negative on 2019-01-10 .
The tunneled catheter line was changed over a wire and the tip was also negative .
2. Respiratory - Intubated for airway protection due to change in mental status .
Extubated 12-28 with no incident .
3. ECG changes - Patient had an episode of chest pain during her hospital stay that was both right and left sided with no radiation and no associated symptoms .
ECG showed new diffuse TWI in all leads .
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were normal .
Echo was obtained which showed WMA and EF of 35-40% .
Pt was note started on ASA as she does not tolerate this well , BB was also not started given SBPs in the 110s .
Statin was also deffered .
She may be started on ASA , BB , statin by PCP as Stephen .
4. Shoulder fracture - Patient is s/p a left hip fracture ( decision not to operate ) and a left shoulder fracture with hemiarthroplasty 11-14 .
Patient was found to have a new humerus fracture distal to the hardware on film this admission .
Assumed to be secondary to trauma when moving patient into ambulance .
CMED service was consulted and recommended wtd woulnd care and sling at all times .
Wound care should be continued as described after discharge .
5. Type 2 DM - Patient was initially covered with an insulin drip while septic and then transitioned back to insulin sliding scale .
6. ESRD on HD - Pt has ESRD secondary to her DM and is on HD .
She was dialysed but was slightly limited by hypotension .
Dialyzed 12-28 with plan to dialyze again 12-31 .
Her dialysis was managed by renal service in house .
7. PE ( 11-14 )- On heparin drip .
Restared coumadin on 12-29 .
Heparin discontinued on 01-01 when INR was 2.0 .
Coumadin was stopped and she received fFP for tunneled line change over a wire .
Coumadin was restarted at a dose of 2 mg qhs .
This should be titrated after discharge for INR goal of 2-3 .
8. PVD :
Dry gangrene of toes bilaterally w/ necrosis of the heels and posterior calf .
Continue to monitor for sign of infection .
On vit C. and zinc as well to aid w/ wound healing .
Wound care consult given anasarca to prevent decub .
9. Left UE markedly more edematous than right UE , this could be from fracture , or there could be a clot , an abscess in the area also a possiblity .
Ultrasound without clot .
Continue elevation and tight dressing to LUE >
10. Access - Left IJ placed 12-26 in Juan was discontinued during the hospitilization .
Right dialysis catheter ( 2018-11-05 ) was changed over a wire 2019-01-08 .
PICC line placed 2019-01-08 , this should be discontinued immediately after pt finishes the linezolid course .
11. Code status - Initially full code then made DNR / DNI after family meeting on 02-27 .
Made full code again on 12-30 after family meeting with son .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59 year old male with a past medical history significant for an atrioseptal defect repair at age 18 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45% and a recent cardiac myocardial infarction , pulmonary hypertension and mitral regurgitation , and atrial fibrillation .
He was seen by his primary care physician the day before admission and complained of two weeks of increasing shortness of breath and fatigue , weight gain and abdominal fullness .
He was sent to the Emergency Department for further evaluation .
The patient reported feeling at his baseline with chronic mild dyspnea on exertion until two weeks prior to admission .
During this period he had also been weaned off of his Digoxin starting early in February .
Over the two weeks prior to admission he had noticed an increasing heart rate from his baseline in the 60s to a heart rate in the 120s .
He had also some increased shortness of breath and a 10 pound weight gain and new three to four pillow orthopnea with a dry cough .
He denied fevers , chills , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or diaphoresis .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Atrioseptal defect repair in 1970 , cardiomyopathy , right-sided congestive heart failure , pulmonary hypertension , history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter , history of prostate cancer , status post brachytherapy , history of rectal bleeding , obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP .
ALLERGIES :
ACE inhibitors , possible allergy to barium reported by the patient during a barium swallow 25 years ago .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Digoxin 0.125 , discontinued one month prior to admission , Toprol XL 100 mg daily , Trazodone 50 mg once daily , Lipitor 10 mg daily , Diovan 40 mg daily , Atrovent / Albuterol prn , Pulmicort , Coumadin 2.5 mg daily , Vitamin E , Vitamin C , iron supplement .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Remote history of tobacco , occasional alcohol use .
He is a retired fire fighter .
LABORATORY DATA :
White blood cell count 10.5 , hematocrit 38.1 , platelets 254 , INR 1.8 .
Sodium 140 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 38 , creatinine .7 , TSH 1.8 , Digoxin level less than 0.2 .
Serial cardiac enzymes negative .
ALT 14 , AST 31 , alkaline phosphatase 283 , total bilirubin 1.0 , amylase 71 , glucose tolerance test 317 .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter .
Echocardiogram showed moderate dilated left atrium , no atrioseptal defect , severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe left ventricular systolic function and moderately dilated right ventricle .
There was global hypokinesis apical throughout the right ventricle and abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular volume overload .
Moderate to severe 3+ mitral regurgitation and 3+ tricuspid regurgitation along with moderate pulmonary early systolic hypertension .
Of note , this echocardiogram was performed when the patient was tachycardiac .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Hypotension - The patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s .
Upon admission it was unclear whether or not the patient was volume overloaded or volume depleted .
Initially he was treated with intravenous fluids with a dramatic response in his systolic blood pressure .
However , subsequent it was determined that the patient 's hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure .
Therefore the focus of treatment was changed to controlling his rate .
2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient 's Digoxin had been weaned off prior to his admission .
It was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .
The patient was loaded once again with Digoxin and his beta blocker was increased to 100 mg of Lopressor , three times a day .
In addition the patient was started on Verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s .
3. Congestive heart failure - During the initial course of the patient 's admission , it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted .
The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids , however , subsequently he was diuresed when he became symptomatic and short of breath .
Chest x-rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure .
The decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient 's heart failure .
In addition , plans were made to evaluate the patient 's cardiac arteries to determine if he had any component of ischemic cardiomyopathy .
4. Abnormal liver function tests - The patient had an isolated , elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase .
An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis , however , an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease .
There was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system .
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass .
Again seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion .
The patient also revealed a prior history of heavy alcohol use for approximately 20 years , during the mid 1950s to mid 1970s .
It was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use .
5. Fall - The patient had a mechanical fall during his admission .
He did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued .
He was walking in the hall , dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance .
He fell backwards , landing on his buttocks and bumped his head .
His neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma .
A computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage .
6. Rectal bleeding - The patient has a history of rectal bleeding , ever since his brachytherapy for his prostate cancer .
The patient has been treated with Argon laser therapy in the past for his rectal bleeding and it is recommended that he follow up with his gastroenterologist for repeat Argon laser therapy .
The remainder of the hospital course will be dictated by the covering intern .

Brief Hospital Course :
Ms. Bridge was admitted from OSH for coronary artery bypass surgery .
She underwent usual pre-operative testing along with carotid ultrasound .
CNIS revealed carotid stenosis and she ultimately underwent left carotid stenting by vascular surgery on 10-30 .
Please see report for details .
On 11-02 she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 .
Please see operative report for surgical details .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition .
Later on op day sedation was weaned , she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated .
On post-op day one chest tubes were removed and beta blockers and diuretics were initiated .
She was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight .
Also on this day she was transferred to the SDU .
Early on post-op day two Ms. Bridge had an episode of aphasia .
She underwent an immediate head CT and Neuro consult and was transferred back to the CSRU .
CT was negative and she returned to baseline neuro status without deficits by arrival to CSRU .
Neurology concluded episode was most concerning for TIA .
Epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day four .
After remaining stable in the CSRU for several days without change in neuro status she was transferred back to the SDU on post-op day four .
She was then started on Heparin with transition to Coumadin ( goal INR of 2-3 secondary to h/o bilateral DVT 's).
During entire post-op course she was followed by physical therapy for strength and mobility .
She continued to improve steadily over the next several days without any other post-op 
complications .
She was discharged on post-op day 11 .

01-11 MRI Left Knee w/o Contrast
1. Bucket handle medial meniscal tear with flipped fragment in the intercondylar notch .
Complex tear involving the posterior Ellison and body .
2. Moderate knee joint effusion with possible ganglion cyst at the insertion of the PCL .
3. Discoid lateral meniscus .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Anders was admitted for anticoagulation and hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of saddle pulmonary embolus and left knee injury .
#. PE :
Given no other risk factors or likely causes , the most likely etiology for his embolus is DVT from the left leg .
He has no known clotting disorder but did have trauma to leg prompting immobility and stasis .
He remained hemodynmically stable throughout his hospitalization and did not have an oxygen requirement upon discharge .
Given no evidence of hemodynamic instability , lysis was not required .
He was anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin .
He will need to follow up with hematology for an outpatient thrombophilia work-up ( not done as inpatient as results would not change acute management of PE ).
He will also require close follow up with his primary care provider for coumadin management .
Duration of his coumadin therapy to be determined by hematology , but likely to be at least 6 months in duration .
#. Syncope :
In setting of PE .
Remainder of his cardiac workup was negative .
He did have a small troponin leak , felt to be related to right heart strain in the setting of P-pulmonale related to clot burden .
His tronponin quickly trended down and he did not have EKG evidence of ischemia .
An ECHO did not reveal any wall motion abnormalities related to ischemia .
#. Hematocrit :
Dropped from 42.7 to 36 in setting of anticoagulation for saddle PE and IV fluids .
No active bleeding noted .
Pt asymptomatic .
#. L knee injury :
Given his history and physical exam , Mr. Anders presented with an injury most consistent with meniscal tear .
In order to facilitate therapy and to promote mobility , an MRI of the knee was done .
He was seen by physical therapy and will need to follow up with orthopaedics upon discharge for repeat evaluation .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
Shortness of breath .
The patient was maintained on albuterol nebulizer treatments and Ipratropium nebulizer treatments , as this was apparently thought to be related to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Given the presence of consolidation on chest x-ray , however , and previous history of pneumonia , the patient was maintained on antibiotics of Zithromax 500 mg daily and ceftriaxone .
The patient was also started on Solu-Medrol IV for active airway disease component of her shortness of breath .
The patient was maintained on supplemental oxygen and sputum production was maximized with the help of an Acapella device and respiratory therapy .
Mucomyst was also considered as a mucolytic component towards secretions .
Adrenal insufficiency .
The patient was maintained on IV Solu - Medrol 60 mg q. 8 h.
Chest soreness .
The patient describes chest discomfort without any significant EKG changes .
The patient was maintained on Percocet p.r.n. for pain relief .
This was thought to be related to musculoskeletal .
There was no evidence of acute rib factors on her chest x-ray .
GI .
The patient was maintained on PPI for reflux disease and known gastritis .
CMED .
The patient has a history of neurogenic bladder and , therefore , she required a Foley catheterization .
Endocrine .
The patient was on Levoxyl at home as her home dose for hyperthyroidism .
CMED CSRU transfer .
The patient was transferred on the evening of 2012-05-22 to the ICU given persistent carbon dioxide retention and respiratory acidosis and the intermittent mental status changes .
The patient had had ABG on the floor , which prompted her to transfer to the ICU .
Her pH was 7.23 , PCO2 73 , PO2 146 on a nonrebreather .
The patient had BiPAP initiated once she reached the unit , but did not tolerate it , becoming apneic and obstructing .
The patient was switched to 2 liters nasal cannula and oxygen saturating at 98 to 100 percent .
After BiPAP was initiated , the patient became hypotensive down to 75/28 and bradycardiac , responding to 3 fluid boluses over the course of the night .
The patient was started on Florinef for concern of adrenal insufficiency ; however , she was hemodynamically stable that morning and was transferred back out to the floor .
It was thought that the patient may have been mucous plugging during her stay in the ICU .
Hematologic .
The patient has a history of high MCV and megaloblastic cells on smear in the setting of anemia ; question B12 deficiency , the patient also has a history of borderline low B12 levels .
The patient was diagnosed for B12 deficiency due to her long history of poor p.o. intake .
Methylmalonic acid levels were sent , the results are pending at the time of discharge .

Relevant Imaging :
1) Bilateral LE doppler ( 06-14 ): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremities bilaterally .
2) Cxray ( 06-14 ): New bibasilar consolidations are demonstrated accompanied by bilateral small pleural effusion .
The lung volumes are slightly increased .
There is no pneumothorax identified .
3) CT Torso ( 06-17 ):
1. Marked interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette .
Together with the interval development of bilateral pleural effusions , this indicates cardiac insufficiency ( or alternatively volume overload ) and an echocardiogram may be indicated for further evaluation .
2. Bilateral basilar compressive atelectasis .
Superimposed infectious consolidation is likely .
3. Interval development of tree-in-Eric nodular opacities and scattered ground glass opacities involving the right lung , concerning for an infectious process .
The differential diagnosis of this is wide including viral , fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections .
Drug toxicity would be a consideration , although somewhat less likely given the unilaterality of the findings .
4. New jejunal wall thickening with persistent distal ileal wall thickening and diffuse mesenteric stranding , most likely reflecting an infectious etiology .
5. Overall stability in metastatic burden .
4) ECHO ( 06-18 ): Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function .
Mild posterior mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation .
Small ( 0.6 cm ) circumferential pericardial effusion , largest around the left atrium .
5) L femur xray ( 06-18 ): Predominantly sclerotic lesion with interval periosteal new bone formation involving the intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric regions .
No displaced fracture is demonstrated .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Mcelveen 51 year-old male with metastatic RCC on Sutent since 2018-12-21 , admitted with fever , hypoxemia , and bibasilar pneumonia .
1) Bibasilar pneumonia : Patient was treated for community-acquired pneumonia .
He was initially placed on Ceftriaxone , Levaquin , and Flagyl in the ICU but then changed to 
Azithromycin & CTX at time of transfer to the oncology service .
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and CT scan suggested ground glass opacities , suggestive of an underlying infectious process .
ECHO was done and confirmed normal ejection fraction .
His respiratory status improved slowly , oxygen was weaned off , and he was discharged on course of Levaquin .
2) Metastatic RCC : Sutent was held on admission in light of acute infection .
He underwent a staging CT scan torso which suggested no significant increase in tumor burden .
Patient was also found to have abnormal TFTs on Sutent and was started on replacement 
therapy .
He will need follow-up bloodwork as an outpatient .
Recent CT scan showed destruction of L femoral neck .
He underwent an xray of the L femur which did not suggest an acute fracture .
No limitations were placed in regards to weightbearing status .
Patient was instructed to restart Sutent next Monday .
3) Renal insufficiency : Creatinine improved from 2.1 to 1.3 at time of discharge .
Likely related to underlying malignancy as well as prerenal component given improvement with gentle hydration .
Medications on Admission :
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : He takes Imodium and Lomotil while on Sutent for diarrhea .

Since 2012-02-26 , the patient has been stable .
The Whidden Memorial Hospital hospital course has been smooth with the patient progressively improving .
The patient was initially on several antibiotics included Cefepime , Vancomycin , Ciprofloxacin , Ambazone and Flagyl .
The patient 's HSV antibody titer was found to be negative and the patient 's Acyclovir was not restarted .
Infectious disease continued to follow and on 2012-02-29 , the patient spiked again which at that time was felt to be due to his central line and the central line was resited on the left side and the patient was started on intravenous Vancomycin .
Over the following days until discharge , the patient remained afebrile and on 2012-03-09 , in fact all the patient 's antibiotics were discontinued .
As for the patient 's ALL and AML , the patient was started on a new chemotherapy protocol called hyper-CVAD on 2012-03-06 .
After the patient began on this protocol , his white blood cell count steadily began to climb .
The patient became no longer neutropenic .
The patient 's also began to climb and the percent blasts in his differential decreased significantly .
The patient had no further complaints and on 2012-03-10 , his white blood cell count was 2.3 , neutrophils 50% , bands 2% , lymphocytes 5% , monocytes 40% , and blasts 1% .
Platelet count was 759,000 .
The patient was discharged to home with instructions to return to the hospital on Monday , 2012-03-12 , for follow-up and laboratory checks .
The patient was also given instructions to be prudent and stay away from public places as well as small children .
The patient was also told to continue on a neutropenic diet .
The patient was also told that he would have to be admitted for several days during his next cycle of CVAD .
The patient was discharged to home in good condition .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Robert Mackey is a 49 year old gentleman with a 22 year history of diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of peripheral neuropathy , kidney transplantation in 2003 secondary to diabetic nephropathy , as well as throat cancer in 2004 treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation .
Mr.  Mackey also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy ; a cervical MRI scan showed very impressive disc herniations at C5-C6 , less so at C4-C5 , with clear cut cord compression , particularly on the right side C5-C6 .
Therefore , he was admitted for C4-C5 and C5-C6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees ; blood pressure 145/80 ; pulse 60 ; respiratory rate 10 ; 100% on a non-rebreather .
He was awake , alert , uncomfortable secondary to incisional tenderness at neck site as well as right iliac graft site .
The wounds were clean , dry and intact , and flat .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
While in the PACU , Anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his SAO2 dropped to 89% .
His respiratory rate was 30 on face mask .
Interoperatively , he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate , although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively .
He responded to intravenous Lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement .
The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume .
No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia , although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction .
He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully .
He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume .
He was also put on Lopressor 150 mg twice a day .
Also in the Intensive Care Unit , O2 saturation was closely monitored .
The patient became agitated with both tent and Bi-PAP machine , although continued to saturate well .
He was transferred to Medicine the morning of 2010-08-30 , for continued medical management post surgery .
On the day of transfer , the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium ; thus , a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants .
1. When his O2 saturation was monitored , his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay .
2. His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued ; those included Temocillin , Nortriptyline , Haldol , Lorazepam , Venlafaxine , Bupropion , and Gabapentin .
In addition , his cyclosporin levels were checked .
3. Hypo or hyperglycemia :
Mahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control .
Finger sticks were in the 150 s when acutely agitated , therefore , it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory .
4. Infectious causes were evaluated .
He was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F. ; yet , chest x-ray , blood cultures , urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources .
A lumbar puncture was considered , although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure .
5. Mass effect was considered , although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium , it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality .
A head and neck CT scan , non-contrast , were ordered though to evaluate for such processes .
No acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted , although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C2 .
This was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery .
6. Trauma was also considered .
The patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma , no loss of consciousness .
Throughout his stay , Chem-10 was monitored .
There were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium .
Liver function tests were checked , only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 .
TSH was within normal limits as was B12 and folate .
RPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked .
The assay was nonreactive .
An EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus , although again this did not seem to be a likely cause .
On the evening of the 22nd , the patient became acutely agitated , threatening to leave , and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving .
Security was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in four-point
restraints , for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital .
The restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on 08-31 .
Later in the morning on 08-31 , the patient was more oriented and alert , and asked to have the restraints removed .
They were taken off two at a time .
The patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event .
Intramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered p.r.n. for emergency use should he become acutely agitated .
haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd .
Each progressive day,  Mr. Donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on 09-01 .
The likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy .
Other concerns during his stay was his kidney function , due to his renal transplant in 2003 .
His immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay ; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4 ; he has a baseline renal insufficiency .
With this in mind , when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option .
While the patient was in restraints , gentle hydration was initiated since p.o. intake was not adequate .
As for his diabetes mellitus , the Mahoney Team provided updated recommendations each day , adjusting for the changing p.o. intake .
The only other complaints from Mr. Mackey during his stay were :
Soreness at his operative sites , for which he was given p.r.n. Tylenol once his delirium had resolved .
In addition , he also complained of difficulty with swallowing , necessitating only soft and liquid diet .
This was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed 2010-08-27 .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged on 09-02 .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
1. Follow-up with Dr. Williams on Tuesday , 09-07 , at noon .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Cordano is a 58-year-old gentlemen with a past medical history significant for primary sclerosing cholangitis who presented with a chief complaint of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram .
The most recent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was done in 2009-07-25 .
At the time an 8 Caucasian catheter was placed in the common hepatic/bioduct for external drainage .
The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography also showed the presence proximal common bile duct .
Nodularities in the common bile duct visualized by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was also worrisome for cholangiocarcinoma and the patient was admitted to the Blue General Surgery Service for possible surgical interventions .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Ulcerative colitis , primary sclerosing cholangitis .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Status post placement of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage with placement of 8 Caucasian nephrostomy catheter in the common bile duct .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Ursodiol 600 mg t.i.d.
2. Ambien 5 mg q.h.s.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
The patient is a jaundiced looking gentlemen in no acute distress .
The head is normocephalic , atraumatic and eyes are icteric .
The neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy .
The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart has a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 , S2 .
There is no murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , no masses and nondistended .
There is no hepatosplenomegaly .
Rectal exam showed no masses and is guaiac negative .
The extremities have distal pulses and were warm and well perfused .
Neurological exam was grossly intact .
LABORATORY STUDIES AT ADMISSION :
A white blood cell count of 14.2 , hematocrit of 35.3 , platelet count of 449,000 .
Sodium of 130 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.1, prothrombin time 14.1 , partial thrombin time 29.7 .
INR 1.4 .
ALT 106 , AST 149 , alkaline phosphatase 242 .
Total bilirubin 10.1 , amylase 90 and lipase 112 .
RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES AT TIME OF ADMISSION :
Chest x-ray revealed minimal left base atelectasis and elevation of left hemidiaphragm .
A CT scan with po contrast showed dilation of intrahepatic common bile duct which is improved from previous studies .
It is also noted that there was splenomegaly .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Cordano was admitted on 2009-08-17 for a replacement of transhepatic biliary drainage catheter .
At that time , cholangiogram confirmed that there was a distal stricture of the common bile duct .
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography also demonstrated similar findings
and it is noted there was nodularity in the common bile duct which is worrisome for cholangiocarcinoma .
Therefore , the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2009-08-24 for a Whipple procedure versus hepaticojejunostomy .
On exploration of the abdomen revealed significant nodularity of the liver indicating of advanced cirrhosis .
Intraoperative frozen section of the distal and proximal common bile duct in the
region nodularity , which is identified previously by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , and regional lymph nodes were all sent to pathology .
They were all negative for malignancy and therefore a hepaticojejunostomy
was performed .
Cholangiogram on postoperative day number two showed no evidence of leakage at the anastomosis site .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and he was sent to the floor in stable condition .
The patient 's postoperative course was notable for an elevation in white blood cell count peaking at 30.0 on postoperative day number two .
He was given Unasyn for empiric antibiotic treatment .
At the time , blood , urine and bile was sent for culture , which were all negative .
A chest x-ray was also negative for any pneumonia .
Postoperatively , Mr. Cordano also suffered from low urine output ranges between 25 to 30 cc per hour .
Fractional excretion of sodium was less than 1% suggesting a prerenal etiology .
The sodium creatinine peaked at 2.0 and the patient was treated with boluses of intravenous fluid and intravenous albumin infusion was also administered .
He responded well to this regimen and made adequate urine output .
At the same time , the patient also developed distentions of the abdomen consistent with accumulation of ascitic fluid .
He also had significant lower extremity and scrotum edema .
On postoperative day number eight , the patient 's oxygen saturation dropped to 85% on room air and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for fluid management .
Chest x-ray and sputum culture obtained at the time were negative and the patient was treated with 100% nonrebreather which improved his oxygenation .
While he is in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit , paracentesis was performed and it
revealed greater than 24,000 white blood cell count in the ascites which is consistent with SVT .
He was given Zosyn for empiric treatment .
Gram stain and culture of the ascites failed to identify any organism .
He was weaned from oxygen requirement and was continued on normal saline boluses and
intravenous albumin for treatment of prerenal azotemia .
Somatostatin and midodrine were also given for this condition and he also received packed red blood cells .
On postoperative day number ten , the patient returned to the floor with improved renal function and without oxygen requirement .
The somatostatin and the midodrine were discontinued and the regimen of Lasix and spironolactone was started for diuresis .
His creatinine levels trended toward normal and the fractional excretion of sodium also increased indicating a resolution of the prerenal kidney failure .
On postoperative day number 17 , the patient was discharged .
At the time he took good po .
He has a PICC line in place for continued treatment with Rocephin and he will have a visiting nurse to help him to administer these medications .

On 2016-06-26 , he had a positive exercise tolerance test .
Cardiac catheterization at the end of October revealed a dilated aortic root to 4.4 cm and 80% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending at the bifurcation involving the diagonal branch , 70% stenoses of the left circumflex and oblique marginal artery and 90% stenosis of the posterior descending artery .
His atrioventricular valve gradient was 27 with an AV surface area of .91 .

Palpable dorsalis pedis pulses .
No varicosities noted .
The patient was also noted to be right handed .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the cardiac surgery service for an elected Bental procedure with homograft and coronary artery bypass graft .
Once consent and preoperative evaluation was complete , he was taken to the operating room .
Please refer to the previously dictated operative note of 2016-12-30 by Dr. Lawrence .
Briefly , the patient was taken to the operating room to repair his critical aortic stenosis , his coronary artery disease and his significantly dilated ascending aortic aneurysm .
The procedure was an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve , a coronary artery bypass graft procedure where five grafts were performed .
The left internal mammary artery was connected to the proximal left anterior descending and saphenous vein grafts were connected to the posterior descending artery , diagonal branch , obtuse marginal and distal left anterior descending .
Finally , a super coronary arch graft was implanted .
This was a .................... graft .
Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 234 minutes .
His aorta was cross clamped for 168 minutes .
He had pharmacologic circulatory arrest for 18 minutes .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the unit , intubated on Milrinone , Levophed and Propofol drips .
The rest of the hospital stay can be discussed in terms of system based approach .
Pulmonary :
The patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .
After that , the patient had no major problems with his lungs .
His oxygen saturations remained good and he did not require supplemental oxygen more than a couple of days after his extubation .
He was sent to the floor from the cardiac surgery recovery unit on postoperative day number seven .
After an extended stay for hemodynamic monitoring and pressor support to maintain his perfusion .
Neurologic :
The major neurologic event of this hospital course was that the patient was slow to awake after his Propofol drip was discontinued .
Because of his confusion , a neurology consult was obtained and subsequent radiographic imaging revealed chronic appearing infarcts in the right occipital lobe as well as both cerebellar hemispheres , suggestive of more chronic infarcts , as well as an area in the left corona radiata , adjacent to the left lateral ventricle which may or may not be an acute infarct .
This was seen on the CAT scan on postoperative day number one , 12-31 .
As the patient became more awake , he still remained somewhat confused and a little bit out of it .
In addition , he was noted to have a right sided hemiplegia .
Over his postoperative course , Mr. Douglass has gradually been able to utilize more and more of his right side and with the assistance of physical therapy and occupational therapy , he has 4 to 5 + strength in his right hand and arm and about 4 + strength in his right leg .
He is able to walk about the floor on the days prior to discharge , with the assistance of the physical therapist and nurses .
In addition , Mr. Douglass is given Trazodone to help him sleep at night .
A psychiatric consult was also obtained due to his mental status and confusion postoperatively but his psychiatric issues are mostly related to his neurologic insults and he has no distinctive psychiatric disorder , except for perhaps postoperative delirium .
Cardiovascularly , the patient did extremely well following the surgery .
The Levophed drip was continued until postoperative day number one .
Milrinone was continued until postoperative day number three , at which point he was having good enough cardiac output that he did not need these drips to help maintain his blood pressure anymore .
He has remained without any chest pain following this procedure and his sternal wound is clean , dry and intact at the end of the procedure .
In addition , he has hypertension , for which he receives Metoprolol and he has hypercholesterolemia , for which he receives nothing at this time .
Pulmonary :
The patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .
He was diuresed and was soon saturating very well on room air .
Gastrointestinal :
The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease , for which he has been receiving Zantac as an inpatient .
We will put him back on his Nexium .
In addition , over the last couple of days prior to discharge , the patient did appear a little bit icteric .
Liver function tests were obtained and they were slightly elevated liver function tests and ALT was 44 , AST was 34 ; alkaline phosphatase was 199 , within normal limits .
Total bilirubin was 2.8 .
Amylase was 108 and lipase was 213 .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound did not reveal any gallstones or common bile duct dilatation indicative of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis .
In addition , the patient did have slightly elevated blood sugars over the last couple of days and has required an insulin sliding scale and basal insulin to maintain his blood sugars at a more appropriate level .
The ideal blood sugar levels for Mr. Douglass in this postoperative period should be less than 140 .
Please stay on top of the sliding scale so that the patient can keep a euglycemic level .
Hematologic :
The patient , during this admission , required transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells to maintain adequate hematocrit .
At the time of discharge , Mr. Norman hematocrit is at 40.7 .
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient did receive a significant amount of diuresis postoperatively and is well below his baseline with weight , most likely because of his inability to eat because of his stroke .
Once he was coherent enough , the patient was evaluated by the swallow team who
declared him at first an aspiration risk .
As Mr. Douglass has improved from his initial stroke , he has become more lucid
and is less of an aspiration risk .
On 01-12 , one day prior to discharge , he was cleared by the swallow team to eat
a diet as he wishes .
He is going out on a cardiac healthy , diabetic diet , as tolerated with Boost supplements .
Infectious disease :
The patient had positive blood and urine cultures on 01-05 for history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus , which was pan sensitive .
He was started on Oct. 25 for this bug .
On 01-08 , the patient 's central venous line was discontinued .
The catheterization tip also grew out Serratia .
On the 16th , a urine culture was obtained and did grow out greater than 100,000 colonies of E. coli which was intermittently resistant to Ciprofloxacin .
He was started on Bactrim for that .
Please continue Mr. David Montero for one month to fight his blood borne infection , to prevent seeding of his aortic graft and continue Bactrim for ten days after discharge to treat the E. coli in his urine .
DISPOSITION :
Mr. Douglass is being discharged on 2017-01-13 to a rehabilitation facility in good condition .
FOLLOW-UP :
One to two weeks with his primary care physician and two to three weeks with his cardiologist and at one month with Dr. Costello .

CT Abd 02-21 :
1. Markedly dilated colon throughout ascending , transverse , and descending colon with air-fluid levels , overall unchanged since prior study performed on the same day with pneumatosis in the ascending colon .
Sigmoid diverticulosis with focal narrowing of the sigmoid colon just distal to the dilatation with wall thickening , due to diverticulitis .
This area can be a leading point of obstruction .
An underlying mass lesion or cancer cannot be excluded in this area , and further clinical investigation is recommended .
2. Limited evaluation for known sigmoid-vesicle fistula .
3. Small amount of ascites , somewhat increased anterior to the liver .
4. Bilateral renal cysts .
5. Heavy calcification of the aorta and SMA and its branches .
Due to atherosclerosis , assessment of the intraluminal process of these branches is limited .
CTA/CT abd 03-07 :
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism .
Small bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis .
2. Left lower quadrant thick-walled peripherally enhancing fluid collection , which appears to communicate with the sutured end of the proximal sigmoid colon via a small collection of extraluminal gas .
In the correct clincial setting , this could be consistent with an abscess .
3. Moderate intraabdominal ascites .
4. Status post ileostomy without evidence of small-bowel obstruction .
5. Distended gallbladder .
6. Diverticulosis within the right remnant sigmoid colon .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was a direct admission to the operating room on 02-12 , at which time she underwent an
aortic valve replacement .
Please see the operative report for full details .
In summary , she had an aortic valve replacement with a #21 mosaic porcine valve .
She tolerated the operation well , and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit .
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period , however , her blood pressure remained somewhat labile .
Therefore , she was continued on a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 110 .
In addition , she was slow to awaken after her anesthesia was reversed , and in several attempts to wean from the ventilator , she developed a respiratory acidosis .
She therefore remained on the ventilator throughout the day of postoperative day one .
On postoperative day two , the patient remained hemodynamically stable .
Her Neo-Synephrine drip was weaned to off .
She was again weaned from the ventilator , and successfully extubated .
Her chest tubes were discontinued and , at the end of the day , she was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation .
After being transferred to the floor , the patient did well .
Over the next several days , her activity level was increased with the assistance of Physical Therapy and the nursing staff .
She remained hemodynamically stable .
Her respiratory condition remained stable and , on postoperative day four , she was deemed stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and physical
therapy .
At the time of transfer , the patient 's physical examination is as follows :
Vital signs :
Temperature 98.4 , heart rate 78 and sinus rhythm , blood pressure 106/50 , respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 97% on room air .

REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mitral valve repair .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52 year old Czech speaking gentleman with a history of severe mitral regurgitation .
For the past several years , the patient has continued to have significant exercise intolerance which has limited his ability to work .
He reports severe dyspnea on exertion .
The patient had a recent admission earlier in the month and he was discharged on 2015-09-10 , after undergoing cardiac catheterization .
This was significant for demonstrating no flow-limited disease in the coronaries but several fistulae
from the left anterior descending to the PA .
Several of these were coil embolized during this admission .
He tolerated this well , was sent home , and now returns for his mitral valve repair .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Mitral valve regurgitation .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
None .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day .
2. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day .

The patient is currently on Disability and lives at home with his wife .
Kimberly was born in Great Britain .
He denies any ETOH or tobacco use .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is in no acute distress .
Temperature is 98.3 F. ; pulse is 76 ; blood pressure 113/52 ; breathing 18 ; 98% on room air .
HEENT :
The patient is missing many teeth .
Oropharynx is clear .
There is no cervical lymphadenopathy .
Supple neck .
Heart is regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur .
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Abdomen is soft and nontender .
The patient has no cyanosis , clubbing or edema in extremities .
LABORATORY :
On admission include a white blood cell count of 5.6 , hematocrit of 32.5 , platelets of 202 .
Sodium of 140 , potassium of 3.5 , BUN of 4 , creatinine of 0.6 , glucose of 137 .
Chest x-ray shows no infiltrate or pneumothorax .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrates no significant disease in the coronary arteries .
Two branches of an left anterior descending to PA fistula which was successfully coiled .
There is a persistent flow through an inferior branch of the left anterior descending to PA fistula and a persistent branch of the circumflex to PA branch fistula which anatomically were not suitable for coil embolization .
Ejection fraction was 60% .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On the day of admission , the patient went to the Operating Room and underwent a minimally invasive
mitral valve repair .
He tolerated this procedure well .
The patient was brought to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on minimal pressor support .
He was successfully weaned off this support .
The patient was fully weaned from ventilatory support secondary to a persistent acidemia .
This was treated with sodium bicarbonate and a Swan-Ganz was placed to provide close hemodynamic monitoring .
The patient was found to have stable hemodynamics with appropriate mixed venous saturations in the 70% range .
The patient was corrected to a normal pH of 7.41 by the first postoperative night and remained stable .
He was then weaned off of ventilatory support and was successfully extubated .
The patient did have a slight bit of confusion early in post-extubation course which cleared .
This was also compounded by a language barrier since the patient cannot speak English .
In addition , the patient 's early postoperative course had a tremendous urine output .
It was equally up to 700 cc. an hour and a renal consultation was obtained .
He underwent a head CT scan to rule out intracranial pathology leading to diabetes insipidus .
This was negative .
The patient 's serum and urine electrolytes indicated that this diuresis was appropriate .
The patient 's urine output has decreased and his BUN and creatinine remained normal .
The patient 's Foley was discontinued .
He had developed some hematuria which has resolved .
The patient has remained stable and is now ready for discharge to home with follow-up in approximately four weeks .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Mitral regurgitation status post minimally invasive mitral valve repair .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Lopressor 75 mg p.o. twice a day .
2. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day .
3. Percocet one to two p.o. q. four hours p.r.n.
4. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DIGibsonE INSTRUCTIONS :
1. The patient will follow-up with Dr. de las Grau in four weeks .
2. He will follow-up with his primary care physician , Dr. Blake , in two weeks .
3. The patient will call for any fevers or difficulties with the wound care , and will be instructed with an interpreter present .

Chief Complaint :
Increasing abdominal girth
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
4u FFP
Paracentesis
History of Present Illness :
47 female with h/o HCV cirrhosis compocated by encephalopathy , ascites , and h/o portal vein thrombosis ( right anterior portal vein ) and portalcaval shunt ( reversed flow in main portal vein ) presents from liver clinic with increasing abdominal girth .
She also described sob , nausea , worsening lower ext edema .
She denied abd pain , fevers , chills .
She was admitted for a large volume paracentesis but her INR on admission was 3.8 .
She received 4units of FFP which decreased her INR to 2.2 and then 2 more units during the tap .
She then had 6L of non-bloody ascitic fluid removed without complication .
She received 36gm of albumin following the tap .
Her BP on admission was 120/70 and remained stable following the tap .
Over the next several hours , pt complained of abd pain but this resolved on its own without medication .
In the am , she was found to have a hct of 24 , down from 32 and plts 35 , down from 72 .
She received 2 units of plts and 1 unit of PRBC s.
Her BP was then noted to be decreased at 80/40 which improved mildly to 90/30 with 1.5L of NS .
Temp noted to be low at 94 and she was placed on bear hugger which improved temp to 96.7 .
Her mental status also had decreased from admission and her urine output was minimal , 225cc over the past 12 hours .
Creatinine this am was 1.9 from 0.9 yesterday .
Previous hospital course ( per H&P ):
She was recently hospitalised from 02-23 / 03-04 for abdominal discomfort at which time she underwent paracentesis that ruled out SBP and relieved her abdominal pain .
She also underwent US that revealed patent portal and hepatic vessels .
While her discharge summary maintains that she was continued on Furosemide / Spirinolactone / Propranolol , the patient did not receive any scripts on discharge and as a result did not take these medications .
Also , due to worsening renal function , she was started on octreotide / midodrine / albumin for hepatorenal 
syndrome ( Cr 3.3 at its worst ) which resolved prior to her discharge .
The hospitalisation was also significant for mild DIC for which she received cryoglobulins and UTI (+ Enterococcus and + Klebsiella ).
She received a 7 day course of amoxicillin for which Enterococcus was sensitive but Klebsiella unknown .

RADIOLOGY
1. Small cirrhotic liver with what appears to be a portocaval shunt .
2. Moderate ascites .
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis .
4. No hydronephrosis .
5. Borderline splenomegaly .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P : 48 yo morbidly obese woman with HCV cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy , esophageal varices and partial vein thrombosis ( but no hx of SBP ) presents with increasing abdominal girth likely secondary to ascites .
Admitted for diagnostic / therapeutic paracentesis and then transferred to the ICU for hypotension , confusion and anemia .
# Liver cirrhosis : MELD score of 34 on admission .
Pt became more encephalopathic during her hospital course .
She was not a transplant candidate due to her obesity .
A family meeting was held on hospital day #4 which included the pt 's closest family members , her hepatologist , Dr. Steidl , her PCP , Dr. Popoff and the ICU team .
After it was explained that the pt 's prognosis was very poor given that she was not a transplant candidate , the 
decision was made by the family and the medical team to withdraw care .
The pt was made comfortable and she expired several hours later .
# Recurrent ascites : On the medical floor , pt had a large volume paracentesis ( 6 liters ) followed by replacement with albumin .
She had no evidence of SBP .
# Hypotension : Pt became hypotensive following the large volume paracentesis despite replacement with albumin .
This was thought to be 04-09 the large volume tap verses sepsis though she had no other evidence of sepsis .
She was placed on pressors to maintain a MAP > 55 .
Once the decision was made to withdraw care , the pressors were discontinued .
# Anemia : Hct dropped following the tap and there was concern for bleed into her abdomen .
She received one unit of PRBC s.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of bleed .
Her hematocrit remained stable at 24-26 following the acute drop.
# ARF : Creatinine has increased from 0.9 on admission to 1.9 on admission to ICU .
Urine lytes with Na of 10 indicating either pre-renal or hepatorenal .
Fluid challenge with 36gm of albumin , one unit of PRBCs and 2L of NS .
Will check creatinine this afternoon .
Pt previously diagnosed with hepatorenal and was started on midodrine , octreotide and albumin ; these were 
continued .
Her creatinine continued to increase , likely due to her worsening liver failure .
Pt expired during this admission after family discussion to make her comfort care only .

5. Immunizations received - Hepatitis B vaccine given 2009-01-22 .
6. Immunizations recommended -
Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should be considered from October through April for infants who meet
any of the following three criteria -
1. Born at less than 32 weeks ;
2. Born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for daycare during respiratory syncytial virus season , with a smoker in the household or with preschool siblings ; or
3. With chronic lung disease .
After some debate , we concluded that Vetrano was not at unusually high risk from RSV , but that her sister might be .
Vetrano probably does not need Synagis at least until her sibling is discharged from the hospital .
It may then be reasonable to treat both for the balance of the RSV season .
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they
reach six months of age , before this age the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against
influenza to protect the infant .
7. Follow up - Follow up appointment with primary pediatrician within five days of discharge .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Prematurity , former 32 4/7 weeks , Twin #1
2. Rule out sepsis

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient was admitted originally for airway monitoring status post endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography with adverse reaction to Fentanyl and tongue injury .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 59 year-old female status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on the day of admission , which had been done to evaluate for possible bile leak after cholecystectomy was performed four days ago .
The patient was in her usual state of health until four days prior to admission when she had a cholecystectomy .
Her postop course was uneventful until one day prior to admission when she developed abdominal pain .
She went to an outside hospital Emergency Room and was reassured and sent home .
On the day of admission she returned to the outside hospital Emergency Room where an abdominal CT was performed , which showed " thickened stomach and free air ."
She was sent to New England Sinai Hospital & Rehab Center for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and possible stent placement .
She had a successful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , which showed a bile leak at the duct of Luschka .
A stent was placed successfully .
After her endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography the patient developed " jaw clenching , biting tongue , rigidity and cold / chills ."
The patient received ampicillin , Gentamycin and Flagyl empirically as well as Narcan to reverse fentanyl .
Because of the tongue injury and tachycardia as well as possible infection given her fevers or chills the GI Service transferred the patient to the CMED CCU for close observation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Hiatal hernia .
2. Status post cholecystectomy four days prior to admission .
3. Urinary frequency secondary to interstitial cystitis .
4. Mitral valve prolapse .
5. Tubal ligation many years ago .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Prempro .
2. CMED CCU drops .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies at the time of admission , however , it is assumed that her rigidity and jaw clenching was secondary to Fentanyl .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is married .
She works as a teacher 's aid in Cambridge .
She denies tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE CMED CCU :
Vital signs temperature 100.6 .

There were no ST or T wave changes .
Abdominal CT showed inflammation in the right upper quadrant , small fluid in the circumferential thickening of the distal stomach .
There was a question of a small ulcer .
There was a tiny amount of free air .
This was per report of Vencor Hospital .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In summary the patient is a 59 year-old female who was admitted to Quincy Medical Center for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for possible stent placement for a bile leak secondary to cholecystectomy performed four days prior to admission .
She then suffered rigidity with jaw clenching and tongue biting secondary to Fentanyl administration and was transferred to the CMED CCU for close observation .
She did well overnight in the CMED CCU .
She was started on Ampicillin , Gentamycin and Flagyl .
Her liver function tests and amylase and lipase were followed closely .
On the second hospital day the patient was doing much better and was stable from an airway perspective , so she was transferred to the General Medical Floor .
1. Gastrointestinal :
As stated the patient was status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent
placement for a bile leak from the duct of Luschka .
The patient was continued on Ampicillin , Gentamycin and Flagyl , which had been started at the time of transfer to the CMED CCU .
She had waxing and waning fevers .
However , her white blood cell count was never really elevated and she did not have a bandemia .
On the day of transfer to the General Medical Floor the patient had received clear liquids .
She did not tolerate this very well .
Her amylase and lipase on the day following the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
were elevated .
Amylase was 2304 with lipase being 7116 .
Therefore she was made NPO and given aggressive intravenous hydration .
On the second hospital day on the General Medical Floor the patient had marked rebound to palpation of her abdomen .
She was followed closely with serial abdominal examinations .
Her amylase and lipase were trending down , however .
An abdominal CT was obtained , which showed only mild pancreatitis .
There were no intra-abdominal fluid collections , which required any drainage .
On the third hospital day the patient 's pain was improving and the rebound was decreasing .
Her enzymes continued to trend down .
She received clear liquids in the evening and tolerated these well .
On the day of discharge the patient was tolerating a BRAT diet without significant abdominal
pain .
She had no further rebound .
She had no temperature spikes in greater then 24 hours at the time of discharge .
2. Hematology :
The patient 's hematocrit was 34.8 at the time of admission .
It decreased to 30 in the setting of aggressive hydration .
It remained stable at the time of discharge and it was 29.5 on the day of discharge .
3. FEN :
The patient was aggressively hydrated given that she was NPO .
She required periodic repletion of her potassium .
Her bicarb began to drop and she developed an anion gap acidosis .
This was most likely secondary to ketoacidosis as she had no dextrose in her intravenous fluids .
This was added on the evening prior to discharge and on the day of discharge her anion gap acidosis had resolved .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Levaquin 500 mg one po q day times seven days .
2. Protonix 40 mg po q day .
3. Percocet one to two tablets po q 4 to 6 hours prn .
The patient was given a prescription for ten pills .
4. Prempro as the patient was formerly taking .
5. Trazodone at bedtime .
DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP :
The patient was to make an appointment with Dr. Nicholson within one to two months after discharge for removal of the stent .
In addition , she would follow up with her primary care physician within one to two weeks following discharge .
She was to continue on a BRAT diet over the weekend and two days after discharge she could advance to a low fat no dairy diet .
She could slowly advance back to a normal diet over the next week .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis .
2. Anemia .
3. Hypokalemia .
4. Anion gap acidosis .
5. Bile leak .

Again , this was a 47-year-old female admitted with Berkitt's lymphoma .
HOSPITAL COURSE OVER THESE PREVIOUS DAYS :
1. Liver lesions :
The patient went for a repeat MRI which showed no change in the previously noted enumerable hepatic cyst in her liver .
A Hepatology consult was obtained who felt that the most likely etiology of these cysts were from hepatic candidiasis , although one could not rule out lymphoma involving from Burkitt's .
She will be discharged on AmBisome 300 mg IV q.d. for treatment of her hepatic candidiasis .
This regimen , that being AmBisome , was recommended by the Infectious Disease physicians , who felt that AmBisome was a better drug of choice as compared to fluconazole .
2. Heme :
The patient 's platelets , white count , and hematocrit have all been stable .
Her white count remained elevated despite discontinuing her G-CSF .
However , the patient is not febrile and her white count should be continued to be watched .
3. On the morning of 12-01 , the patient had some transient episodes of hypotension with SBP s in the 70 s.
Her captopril was discontinued , and she was given two IV fluid boluses with appropriate response .
Her blood pressures and all of her vital signs are stable .
4. FEN :
The patient was continued on TPN over the past couple days .
She is also started on marinol 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. and encouraged p.o. intake .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Guarded , but stable .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Burkitt's lymphoma .
2. Hepatic candidiasis .
DISCHARGE STATUS :
The patient will be discharged to an outside hospital .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. AmBisome 300 mg IV q.d.
2. Marinol 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. before breakfast and dinner .
3. Atarax 25 mg IV / p.o. q. 4-6 h. prn for itching .
4. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Protonix 40 mg p.o. / IV q.d.

INDICATION FOR ADMISSION :
Transfer from Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital for an endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Eugene is a 67 year old male with a remote history of chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse 30 years ago , who is transferred now from Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital for an ERCP and work-up for a cystic lesion at the head of his pancreas on CT scan shown at the outside hospital .
The patient presented initially to Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital at the end of December for abdominal pain , and was found to have pancreatitis .
During this admission , two CT scans had shown a question of an enlargement of the head of his pancreas
versus early pseudocyst .
The patient was discharged home early from this admission due to family needs .
While at home , the patient did not do well and could tolerate minimal food intake and lost about 20 pounds in one month .
On an office visit on 01-14 , the patient was found to have significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase .
That evening , the patient again developed abdominal pain " like his pancreatitis " with nausea and vomiting , for which he was admitted to the Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital .
In the Emergency Department at the Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital , the patient was noted to have vomited some heme positive material .
His complete blood count showed 11% bandemia with a total white count of 10 .
A HIDA scan showed no flow , question of pancreatitis versus common bile duct obstruction .
His electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm .
A chest x-ray was unremarkable .
During his admission to Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital , the patient had dropped his hematocrit to the 30 s with recorded melena .
He received an MRCP which was negative for evidence of stones .
An ultrasound showed normal gallbladder with no wall thickening but a dilated common bile duct of 8 mm measured on CT scan .
The patient had an attempted ERCP on 01-18 , which was unsuccessful due to a long nipple like papilla .
He was therefore transferred to Saints Medical Center for endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography .
The patient 's blood cultures at outside hospital grew out Streptococcus sanguis-gordonii on 01-18 .
This was sensitive to Clindamycin , Erythromycin , penicillin S and Vancomycin .
Prior to this result , the patient had already been on Ampicillin , Sulbactam and Gentamycin .
It appears from the Discharge summary that the patient was placed on Unasyn 3 grams intravenously every six hours after his ERCP .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus .
2. Right rotator cuff injury .
3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease with esophageal dilatation for stricture .
4. Recent pancreatitis ; prior history for recurrent pancreatitis 30 years ago from alcohol .

His blood cultures were drawn and pending .
Urinalysis revealed trace glucose , no ketones , no red cells , no white cells and less than one epithelial cells .
COURSE IN HOSPITAL :
The patient was taken down to the endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatogram upon admission .
On this examination , the patient was found to have mild biliary stricture most likely secondary to chronic pancreatitis .
Cytology was obtained .
He was also found to have dilated pancreatic ducts with calcifications consistent with chronic pancreatitis .
The patient underwent a percutaneous sphincterotomy extended to a full sphincterectomy .
He also had successful extraction of stone fragments .
The patient tolerated this procedure well and had no complications .
The patient subsequently underwent a CT scan angiogram with Pancreas protocol to assess the pseudocyst versus enlarged pancreas head .
The results of this study indicated that this structure at the head of his pancreas is most likely a forming pseudocyst ; however , the suspicion of malignancy is still possible and the patient underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy of this mass on 2011-01-20 .
The cytology for this biopsy is still pending .
The patient recovered well status post these two procedures .
He had no complications and no subsequently pancreatitis .
His alkaline phosphatase and all the other abnormal liver function tests were resolving .
He had no pain and did not require any pain medications .
He was tolerating food very well and was afebrile throughout admission .
With regards to the patient 's documented Strep septicemia in the outside hospital , the Infectious Disease Team was formally consulted .
Upon obtaining more information from Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital , it appears that the patient had two out of four bottles growing out Streptococcus sanguis in the outside hospital .
The patient appeared to have been covered by Ampicillin , Gentamycin and then Unasyn in the outside hospital .
The patient , on admission , was placed on Ampicillin , Gentamycin and Flagyl .
With repeated blood cultures that were negative , the patient was reduced to single Mckenzie of intravenous Ampicillin .
For this documented septicemia , this patient went for a endocarditis work-up .
He had a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed no vegetations .
On this echocardiogram , he was found to have mildly dilated left atrium , mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy , and a normal ejection fraction of greater than 55% .
There were no other abnormalities noted on this study .
The patient then underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram on 01-24 .
On this echocardiogram , he was again noted to not have any evidence for valvular vegetations .
A complex plaque was found in the aortic arch in the descending thoracic aorta , although this plaque is non-mobile .
There was focal mitral valve prolapse noted without pathologic mitral regurgitation .
The patient was noted to have trace aortic regurgitation .
A Panorex x-ray of his two teeth were obtained and a Dental Consultation was done .
The patient was thought to have normal dental hygiene and low suspicion for a source of his alpha septicemia from his mouth .
Infectious Disease Department as well as Cardiology had recommended a formal 14 - day course of intravenous antibiotics to treat a documented alpha Streptococcal septicemia from outside hospital blood cultures .
The patient 's insurance company , however , would not pay for home antibiotics .
After much discussion with the patient , the patient was informed of the risks of not finishing a 14 day course of intravenous antibiotics and chose to go home .
He had three days of antibiotics remaining at the time of discharge .
It was discussed with the patient to send him out on Augmentin 500 mg three times a day for ten more days .
He was to follow-up with his primary care physician within two to three days for repeat laboratory studies and blood cultures .
He was to return to the hospital with any signs of shaking chills or fever .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Pancreatitis status post endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy .
2. Alpha Streptococcus septicemia .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Augmentin 500 mg p.o. three times a day times ten days .

There will be further addendum .
Respiratory distress - On 10-12 , the patient was transferred to Medicine Intensive Care Unit secondary to respiratory distress .
In the Medicine Intensive Care Unit , the patient was initially placed on high-flow 60% oxygen face mask and they diuresed approximately 5 liters off into the intravenous Lasix .
The patient actually was improved .
She came back to the floor on 10-14 .
Since then the patient 's oxygenation has been improving and today , 10-17 , she is requiring .5 liters of keep her saturations above 94 .
The patient continues to be diuresed with approximately 20 mg of Lasix a day and she has had good urine output .
Anemia - The patient 's hematocrit dropped in the Intensive Care Unit to the mid 20s and she received one unit of packed
red blood cells with a good response up to 30 .
Hypotension - On the night of 10-16 , the patient was diuresed with 20 mg of intravenous Lasix .
This is the normal dose that she puts out too .
The patient became hypotensive into the 70 s without any symptoms .
Her oxygen saturations were greater than 94% at the time .
The patient was given 250 cc of normal saline and her blood pressure responded coming back up to the high 90 s.
No further episodes of hypotension were noted .
As of the time of this dictation , on 2010-10-17 , the patient appears to be getting better .
Recent chest x-ray shows resolving right lower lobe pneumonia .

The patient early this morning to the Ruthie with his usual nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain and was found to be hypertensive to 256/110 , HR 102 , T 99.2 , RR 22 , 92% RA .
History is difficult to obtain from patient d/t somnolence and lack of desire to participate in interview , but per Frank note he was diaphoretic and ' writing in pain ', vomiting clear substance .
He was given ativan a total of 4 mg of ativan , 6 mg of dilaudid , labetolol 20 mg IV x 1 and hydralazine 10 mg IV x 1 without good response ( 200/99 ).
He recieved 2L NS and was started on labetolol gtt and BP decreased to 161/79 .
Tranferred to CMED CCU for further management while on labetolol gtt .
Of note , the patient is admitted to hospital 3 times every month for similar complaints with last admission 1/20-2/1/07 .
At that time BP was attributed to abdominal pain and inability to take PO meds d/t nausea / vomiting .
Also had labile blood sugars with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia , and Strickland recommended sugars in the range of 150-200 .
He eloped prior to formal discharge when his FS was found to be critically high - recommended to patient that he stay for repeat , but left AMA without signing any forms .
Upon transfer to the CMED CCU the patient appears somewhat uncomfortable , reporting nausea and abdominal pain , but when questioned he was unable / unwilling to participate in HPI or exam d/t sleepiness .
He denied CP , SOB , HA , vision changes , neck stiffness , dysuria , or other symptoms .
In the CMED CCU he became hypotensive to SBP 80 s.
Labetalol was stopped and he received a 500 cc fluid bolus and his blood pressure rose to SBP 90 s.
Cardiac and infectious sources of hypotension were considered , but cardiac enzymes were not changed from prior studies and he had no localizing signs of infection ; blood cultures were sent and a ultrasound of the L arm AVF ordered to rule out abscess at the site .
He received a partial HD session , limited by hypotension .
Over night , his blood pressure trended up to 130 s systolic .
He was restarted on his home blood pressure regimen .
Renal consult team saw him 2019-01-20 and plan to next dialyze him on 2019-01-21 .
He was to be called out to the medical floor on 2019-01-20 but became somnolent after receiving pain and anti-nausea meds , so he stayed in the ICU for closer monitoring of respiratory status , which spontaneously improved .
His blood sugar at 10 pm was low at 22 and he was disoriented , which resolved with two glasses of juice ; he did not receive his standing dose of NPH that evening .
Blood cultures returned positive with GPC in pairs and clusters , so a TTE and surveillance cultures were ordered and vancomycin was started .
He was then called out to the medical floor on 01-21 .

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION :
Included normal CBC , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 up from baseline of about 1.5 .
Troponin 4.7 , CK 101 , MB 3 .
RADIOLOGY :
Chest x-ray showed patient was in congestive heart failure .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
Showed normal sinus rhythm at 107 beats per minute with left axis deviation and poor R-wave progression .
However , no acute changes were apparent .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine Service and treated for presumed diastolic and systolic dysfunction .
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function as well as hypokinesis of the lower half of septum and apex .
Also of note was the distal lateral wall hypokinesis .
The wall motion abnormalities were noted to be new .
It was believed that a troponin on admission in addition to the wall motion abnormalities she underwent a non-Q wave myocardial infarction prior to resulted in her current cardiac failure .
Throughout hospital course patient 's troponin trended down to less than 0.3 .
Heart Failure Service was involved .
She was continued with aggressive diuresis .
She was started on _________ with excellent diuresis , however , her renal functioning worsening .
A cardiac catheterization was deferred until the renal issue could be resolved .
However , her creatinine continued to increase .
Diuresis was halted and without improvement in creatinine .
Renal was consulted .
A renal ultrasound was obtained .
It showed a right kidney size of 6.3 cm and a left kidney size of 8.4 cm .
Given her hypertension which was very difficult to control , it was felt that she had renal artery stenosis and thus she underwent MRA of the kidney which showed severe right renal artery stenosis at its origin .
There was also moderate to severe focal stenosis of the left renal artery approximately 1.3 cm from its origin .
Dr. ______________ consulted on the case .
She was transferred to the unit overnight to assess volume which was noted to be optimal .
On 05-25 she underwent catheterization and subsequent stenting of the left renal artery .
Due to dye load required to assess the coronary disease were not visualized .
After the procedure the patient did well .
However , her creatinine has worsened up to 4.2 .
However , her urine output has improved .
She has not required hemodialysis at this time .
She will need close follow up of her renal functioning .
The patient is discharged to an extended discharge facility .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Non-Q wave myocardial infarction .
2. Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure .
3. Bilateral renal artery stenosis status post stent left renal artery .
4. Acute renal failure .
5. Hypertension .

Reason : 72 male s/p fall down 20 stairs
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
72 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
72 male s/p fall down 20 stairs
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : None .
INDICATIONS : Fall down 20 stairs .
TECHNIQUE : Noncontrast cervical spine CT .
COMPARISON : None .
NOTE : This study was initially performed on 2014-10-21 .
Findings were discussed with Dr. Leanne Vazquez at the time this study was performed , but the study was not dictated until the morning of 2014-10-22 , due to PACS malfunction .
NONCONTRAST CERVICAL SPINE CT : There are minimally displaced and comminuted fractures through the left C7 and T1 transverse processes .
The margins do not appear to extend into the foramina transversaria .
Positioning limits assessment of alignment due to extreme head tilting to the right , but this is likely the best obtainable secondary to intubation and nasogastric tube placement .
Allowing for the limitations , the vertebral bodies are normal in height and normally aligned .
There is no atlantoaxial subluxation .
The lateral masses of C1 articulate normally about the odontoid process .
Prevertebral soft tissue swelling cannot be excluded secondary to intubation .
Extensive carotid arterial calcifications are present in the bulb regions bilaterally .
Biapical lung scarring and mild bronchiectasis are present .
Also noted is sclerosis and opacification of the visualized left mastoid air cells and mastoid tip , likely chronic inflammatory 
disease .
IMPRESSION : Minimally displaced , comminuted fractures of the left C7 and T1 transverse processes .
No evidence of extension into the foramina transversaria .

Reason : bleed ?
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION :
72 year old man with intraparenchymal bleed s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION :
bleed ?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST : None .
INDICATION : Intraparenchymal hemorrhage after fall .
Assess for hemorrhage .
TECHNIQUE : Non-contrast head CT .
COMPARISON : No prior studies are available .
By report , the patient has an outside study .
Should this become available , an addendum will be issued to this report following the comparison with the outside examination .
NOTE : This study was initially performed on the morning of 10-21 , and is being dictated on the morning of 10-22 due to PACS malfunction .
Findings were called to Dr. Leanne Vazquez on the morning of 10-21 .
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT : There is a small amount of hemorrhage within the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles , right greater than left .
Located within the atrium of the right lateral ventricle is an 18 x 10 mm nodular area of increased density which is separate from the choroid plexus .
There is no evidence of surrounding edema .
There is diffuse brain atrophy and chronic microvascular infarction throughout the white matter .
There is a remote right frontal infarct .
There is no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute major vascular territorial infarction .
The ventricles do not appear dilated relative to the sulci , and there is no shift of normally midline structures .
There is no skull fracture .
There is opacification of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx but an NG tube is present , and the patient is intubated .
Opacified and sclerotic left mastoid air cells are noted .
IMPRESSION :
1. Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage .
2. Ovoid 18 - mm density within the atrium of the right lateral ventricle .
This could represent either an atypically located blood clot or an intraventricular mass , and further evaluation with contrast - enhanced MRI of the brain , when clinically feasible , is recommended .
Results were discussed with Dr. Leanne Vazquez in the early afternoon on 2014-10-21 .

Chief Complaint :
large pericardial effusion , transfer from OSH
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure :
Thoracentesis 2018-05-27
History of Present Illness :
82 F with h/o COPD , CAD , pafib and SSS s/p pacer on 05-08 for symptomatic pauses is transferred for large pericardial effusion ? needing drainage and CHF .
She was admitted to Cambridge Hospital 2018-05-24 with ARF ( Cr 3.5 up from 0.9 ) and SOB .
According to her guardian she was discharged to her NH for a few days after her pacer was placed 05-08 , which was complicated by a PTX requiring CT placement which had been d/c 'd in the hospital after resolution of her PTX .
She had some nausea / vomiting and generally was taking poor pos at her NH .
There had been some concern her nausea was due to her amiodarone which had been discontinued about 1 week ago .
She was then sent to Franklin Medical Center 05-24 with lethargy and n/v .
At Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center she was discovered to have ARF , a large pericardial effusion , and bilateral pleural effusions .
She was treated with IVF for her ARF .
She underwent a TTE at Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center today ( 05-26 ) showing mod-lg circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of RV diastolic collapse and no MV inflow evidence of tamponade , pacer wire located in RV apex .
There was still concern for her effusion contributing to her SOB at the OSH so she was transferred for drainage and treatment of CHF .
Today she only complains of some SOB , which she says remains largely unchanged over the past few days .
She denies any CP / cough / fever / abd pain / diarrhea / black or bloody stools / headache .

Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
82 y/o f w h/o afib , SSS s/p pacer 05-08 c/b PTX requiring CT , CAD , who was readmitted 05-24 with ARF and lethargy , found to have a large pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions , with echo showing no evidence of tamponade , who is transferred for possible pericardial effusion drainage and treatment of CHF , as well as drainage of bilateral pleural effusions .
She had a BNP of > 5000 on admission .
Since admission , she ruled out for MI by enzymes , and had a right sided thoracentesis which yielded transudative fluid .
WBC s since admission were as high as 14,000 but normalized .
She also had 2 echocardiograms which revealed persistent pericardial effusions .
She has been gently diuresed but has worsening ARF .
Her O2 requirement has increased despite diuresis .
She denies any CP / cough / fever , abdominal pain / diarrhea , black or bloody stools or headache .
Her urine output decreased to nearly zero .
In the setting of her ongoing pericardial effusion , she was transferred for closer observation to the CCU .
The CCU fellow and team declined to do pericardial drainage , as the pt was hemodynamically stable , without change in appearance of effusion by echo performed at bedside by cards fellow .
As she was felt by the CCU to be a poor candidate for right heart cath , was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure 110 s- 120 s systolic and pulse 70 s- 80 s , she was called out of the CCU and back to the cardiac floor without intervention .
The procedure team was called to consider doing a left thoracentesis , but she was declined because it was felt that her effusions were transudative , secondary to CHF , and it was recommended to treat CHF .
The pt continued to have low urine output .
She was given a lasix drip IV upon call-out of the ICU , and additional boluses of IV lasix , 200 mg then 300 mg IV were given with a good response , however , she remained net positive fluid balance .
Renal consultants did not feel there was an emergent need for dialysis .
A nitro drip was started in an effort to decrease her preload and afterload .
On call out from the CCU , the pt was satting 93% on 4-5L NC , and through the following night , her oxygen requirement increased to NRB , wherein she was satting upper 80 s- low 90 s.
ABG that evening was 7.29/51/56 on 4L NC and early the next morning , was 7.25/62/64 on NRB .
A CXR was performed the evening of 5/16 , showing moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions , stable cardiomegaly and a possible RLL infiltrate .
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started .
She was afebrile .
The morning of 5/17 , her pulsus parodoxicus was 12 .
Because of her ABG , and declining clinical status , the CCU was notified for possible transfer .
The CMED CSRU Intern called the Murphy , Robert Leigh , to give her the update with regards to the pt 's deteriorating clinical status .
It was felt that given her age , multiple co-morbidities , that her prognosis was poor even prior to CCU admission , possible pericardial drainage or repeat thoracenteses .
Goals of care were clarified with her Murphy , Robert Sanchez .
Explained to Lewin that pt will likely need to be intubated , as she cannot lie flat , and most likely cannot undergo pericardial drainage , thoracentesis , or right heart cath with BiPAP ( which would have been the next measure after NRB , and prior to intubation ).
Explained that despite these invasive measures , she still has a very poor prognosis .
Odell stated she had been thinking about this all night of 2018-05-30 , and agreed that this is not what the pt would have wanted .
Odell does not believe the pt would want to be intubated , with central line , right heart cath , in the CCU .
She requested the patient be made Comfort Measures Only .
She was DNR/DNI on admission .
This was documented in the computer , confirmed with Cardiology attending and fellow , and conveyed to the CCU staff , who were informed she may need to go for transfer ( which was subsequently cancelled ).
The pt will be made comfortable , with goals of care shifted towards suppressing her air hunger and pain .
#. SOB : Most consistent with CHF by exam , although unknown what the severity of her COPD is currently .
TTE revealed large pericardial effusion .
Pt is now s/p drainage of right pleural effusion , diagnostic and therapeutic , with studies consistent with transudate , etiology most likely 02-15 CHF .
We continued her albuterol / atrovent nebs , diuresis with IV lasix drip and boluses .
Her 05-27 CXR post procedure w/o PNX , effusion much improved , yet her 05-28 CXR worse than 05-27 with some reaccumulation of right pleural effusion .
Then , on 05-29 , she demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions ( reaccumulated ), right lower lobe infiltrate ( started on vanco / zosyn )-> put on face mask , given lasix x 1 bolus 100 mg , responded somewhat and o2 sat stable in low 90 s.
She was given 200 mg IV lasix X 1 with an additional 100 cc of urine output the evening of 5/16 .
Her lasix gtt continued during this time .
Her oxygen sats did not improve .
She was then made CMO .
See above .
#. Pericardial effusion : unclear etiology , OSH had raised question of RV perforation from pacer , however she had a normal echo appearance of lead , no tamponade by exam .
This has still be known to occur during the placement of pacemaker .
It was felt posthumously that her large pericardial effusion was most likely secondary to a complication of pacer placement , although this was not seen on imaging .
In the last 12 hours of her life , her pulsus was 12 , and she was felt to likely to have aspect of tamponade physiology , since her preload was reduced .
#. CHF : normal EF on TTE so possibly with diastolic dysfunction , ruled out for MI
- See course of diuresis above .
- We continued ASA / imdur / CCB / hold diovan until pt was made CMO .
#. Pleural effusions : Likely due to CHF although had some leukocytosis at admission to OSH .
Mary studies c/w transudate .
- After she was made CMO , the pt was started on Morphine gtt to maximize comfort and minimize air hunger .
#. Afib/SSS : She was A-paced , pacer placed 05-08 in DDDR mode , complicated by PTX requiring chest tube which resolved and tube was removed during admit for pacer , no evidence of PTX on most recent CXR .
Her pacer wires in correct position .
We continued amiodarone until pt was made CMO .
Anticoagulation has not been given this admission .
She was a poor anticoagulation candidate .
We started her on dilt for additional a fib control ( revert back to a fib on 05-29 ), which was stopped when the pt was made CMO .
#. Oliguric ARF : likely prerenal due to n/v poor po intake and poor forward flow , However , need to continue diuresis .
Her urine lytes consistent with ATN , FENA 4% .

EKG demonstrated NSR at 87 bpm , nl axis , nl int , LVH w/ strain pattern , no ischemic changes .
CXR :
Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette , and  particularly the left atrium accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema consistent with heart failure .
Conclusions :
The left atrium is moderately dilated .
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity dilation and severe global hypokinesis .
No left ventricular thrombus is seen .
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure ( PCWP > 18 mmHg ).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe free wall hypokinesis .
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are minimally thickened .
No aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation is seen .
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal .
There is no mitral valve prolapse .
Mild ( 1+ ) mitral regurgitation is seen .
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
There is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion .
IMPRESSION : Moderate symmetric eft ventricular hypertrophy with severe global biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process ( toxin , metabolic , cannot exclude myocarditis ; in the absence of LVH on ECG , an infiltrative process should also be considered ).
Mild mitral regurgitation .
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension .
Very small circumferential pericardial effusion .
Possible abnormality on the aortic valve as described above without aortic regurgitation .
If clinically indicated a TEE would be better able to define an abnormality of the aortic valve .
Brief Hospital Course :
46 - yo-man w/ cocaine abuse presents w/ LE edema and DOE likely from diastolic heart failure in the setting of cocaine use complicated by hypertensive urgency .
Hypertensive urgency :
BP 230/170 on presentation , most likely from chronic HTN exacerbated by cocaine use .
No signs of end-organ damage at present except for elevated creatinine , which is more likely a chronic problem .
The patient was started on labetalol and Lisinopril .
His blood pressure was taken down from 230 systolic to approx 160 systolic / 100 diastolic on discharge .
His lower extremity edema improved with diuresis .
An echo performed on admission showed an LF EF of 25% .
It is hoped with good blood pressure control and use of an ACE-I with follow up in addition to cocaine abstaining will improved his cardiac function .
Renal Failure : creatinine on admission was 1.6 Likely acute hypertensive nephropathy plus probalbe long-standing hypertensive disease .
discharged on ACE-I .
Substance Use : Social work saw patient and counceled him regarding substance abuse .
Discharged with Margaret Hallock , cardiology follow up as well as scheduled appointment with a new PCP @ Newton Health Center .

Service :
CCU
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 57 - year-old female with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia but no prior coronary artery disease history who presented with chest pain .
The patient reports the pain began at 4:00 p.m. on the day of admission .
She reports that it had essentially started earlier in the day with some GERD-like symptoms .
She had taken Maalox but had no relief with this .
The pain was intermittent through the day and then at 4:00 p.m. increased and was also associated with nausea and diaphoresis .
She reports that the pain shot through her back .
The patient has never had these symptoms in the past .
She arrived in the Emergency Room at 8:00 p.m.
At that time , the pain was unremitting .
In the Emergency Room , the patient was given Lopressor , nitroglycerin , and aspirin .
A TP3A inhibitor was not given for concern for dissection .
The patient was found to have 5057 E. Sixth Blvd. elevations in I , aVL , and V1 through V2 and ST depressions in II , III , and aVF .
The patient was taken emergently to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Hypertension .
2. Hypercholesterolemia .
3. Chondrocalcinosis .
4. Carpal tunnel syndrome .
5. GERD .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
1. Atenolol 25 .
2. Crestor 10 q.d.
3. Uniretic 15/25 .
ALLERGIES : The patient has no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient denied tobacco .
The patient denied alcohol or other drug use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Vital signs :
On admission , the patient was afebrile , blood pressure 146/88 , pulse 71 , respirations 18 .
General : The patient was a well appearing female in no acute distress .
Cardiac : Regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 .
No murmurs were appreciated .
Lungs : Clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Abdomen : Soft , nontender , nondistended , good bowel sounds .
Extremities : There was no edema in the extremities .
The dorsalis pedis pulses were 2+ bilaterally .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA : On admission , white count 10.8 , hematocrit 38.2 , platelets 324,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE : The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization where she was found to have two vessel disease .
The proximal LAD was found to have a 90% lesion with a septal branch with a 95% stenosis and a diagonal branch with 99% stenosis .
The patient had twin LAD stents to the LAD diagonal and LAD septal branches with Taxus stents .
This restored flow appropriately .
The patient also had proximal RCA lesion of 80% and a mid RCA lesion of 80-90% which were not intervened upon .
The patient was given an aspirin and Plavix and in addition started on a beta Elmore , Maxine ACE inhibitor , and these were titrated up as her blood pressure tolerated .
Given the fact that the patient had issues with muscle cramping with Atorvastatin in the past , she was started on Pravastatin which should give less of these side effects .
The patient will follow-up with Cardiology in one months time for further management of her coronary artery disease and further evaluation of her remaining RCA lesions .
2. PUMP : The patient had an echocardiogram to assess her LV function .
She was found to have an ejection fraction of 30-35% as well as an akinetic apex and apical mid and septal akinesis .
Given the fact that the patient had significant apical akinesis , she was started on heparin with a transition to Coumadin for anticoagulation for stroke prevention in the setting of apical akinesis .
On discharge , the patient was given Lovenox injections which should be continued until the patient reaches a therapeutic dose of Coumadin .
3. RHYTHM : The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout her hospitalization with no significant events .
The patient had an EP evaluation and will be followed-up by Dr. Welch .
14-087 , the patient had a signal-averaged EKG .
She will follow-up with Dr. Welch with an echocardiogram on 2015-07-24 in a meeting to discuss risk stratification for sudden cardiac death and possible ICD placement .
4. NEUROLOGY : The patient complained of left lower extremity weakness with ambulation two days after her cardiac catheterization .
The patient had no evidence for weakness on examination with good proximal and distal strength in the lower extremities as well as intact sensation .
The patient worked with Physical Therapy and was able to ambulate without difficulty .
She was also able to ascend stairs without difficulty .
The patient was already on an aspirin and Plavix should this represent a small stroke .
However , there was no evidence for neurologic deficit on examination and this will be followed-up by her primary care physician .
5. HEMATOLOGY : The patient was discharged on Coumadin for apical akinesis and stroke risk .
This will be further monitored by her primary care physician , Dr. Banks , who will adjust her Coumadin dose .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE : Stable .
DISCHARGE STATUS : To home .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS : ST elevation myocardial infarction , status post left anterior descending artery stent .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Aspirin 325 q.d.
2. Lisinopril 5 q.d.
3. Toprol XL 100 q.d.
4. Coumadin 5 q.d.
5. Plavix 75 q.d.
6. Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. until therapeutic on Coumadin .
7. Pravastatin 80 q.d.
FOLLOW-UP PLANS : The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician in the week following discharge for further monitoring of her INR and adjustment of her Coumadin dose .
The patient will also follow-up with Electrophysiology with Dr. Welch on 2015-07-24 .
In addition to this , the patient will follow-up with Cardiology , Dr. Foster , and Dr. Upshaw , on 2015-07-06 for further monitoring .

There was no evidence of effusion .
It was difficult to assess free wall motion .
Cardiac catheterization revealed a totally occluded RCA with collaterals , an 80 percent LAD lesion extending distally which was angioplastied but no stent was placed .
Hemodynamics :
The right heart catheterization revealed pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 4 , cardiac output of 8 , and cardiac index of 3.8 , he had an RA pressure of 10 , RV pressure of 43/4 , PA pressure of 37/10 .
ASSESSMENT :
This is an 82 - year-old male with a history of prior tobacco use , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , COPD , gastritis , and TIA who initially presented to Braintree with a non-ST elevation MI and Guaiac positive stools , transferred to St. Margaret's Center for Women & Infants for cardiac catheterization with PTCA to mid LAD lesion complicated by hypotension and bradycardia requiring Atropine , IV fluids and transient dopamine possibly secondary to vagal reaction , subsequently transferred to CCU for close monitoring , hemodynamically stable at the time of admission to the CCU .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CARDIOVASCULAR :
As summarized above , the patient had a non-ST elevation MI with evidence of an 80 percent mid LAD lesion for which he underwent angioplasty without stent placement .
He was initially continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta blocker , statin , and ACE inhibitor .
At the time of discharge , his Plavix was held due to Guaiac positive stools and hematocrit drop throughout admission .
He had a transthoracic echocardiogram the day after admission showing an ejection fraction of greater than 60 percent .
No focal wall motion abnormalities .
He had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath throughout admission .
In regards to his rhythm , he has an underlying right bundle branch block and first-degree AV block which were stable throughout this admission .
He will be followed-up by his cardiologist after discharge .
1. PULMONARY :
He had a history of COPD for which he is on baseline 2 liters of 02 by nasal cannula at home and Albuterol and Atrovent MDI s p.r.n. at home .
He is also on Flovent MDI at home as well .
He was continued on his MDI and was at his baseline 02 requirement throughout admission .
1. RENAL :
He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency likely secondary to hypertension and was admitted with a creatinine of 1.6 .
His ACE inhibitor post MI was initially held due to his creatinine .
However , this responded to IV fluids and his ACE inhibitor was restarted at the time of discharge .
He will need close monitoring of his creatinine post discharge in the setting of reinstitution of his ACE inhibitor .
1. GASTROINTESTINAL :
His stools were noted to be Guaiac positive at the outside hospital and there was still concern for possible GI bleed given continued Guaiac positive stools during this admission and a slight drop in his hematocrit from 39 to 33 .
It was felt most appropriate for him to have an outpatient GI workup , and his PCP was contacted and will arrange for outpatient colonoscopy .
His Plavix was held at the time of discharge due to a question of GI bleed and in the setting of not having a stent placed at the time of catheterization .
He was continued on his aspirin , however .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Coronary artery disease , status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with 80 percent mid LAD lesion , now status post angioplasty .
Hypertension .
Chronic renal insufficiency .
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Guaiac  positive stools .
Anemia .

Attending : Robert E Goldschmidt , M.D.
Addendum :
Just prior to discharge on 11-14 , pt 's BP was found to be 70/40 P70 s just after receiving her am BP meds .
She was asymptomatic .
The patient was kept in the hospital and the following issues were addressed :
1. Hypotension : The patient 'd pm BP meds were held 11-14 and she was administered 1.5L NS over the course of the day with subsequent SBP s in the high 90 s, low 100 s,.
The hypotension was likely due to volume depletion caused by her diarrhea / loose stools in addition to decreased PO intake secondary to her GERD and thrush .
All of this occurred in the setting of aggressive BP management with metoprolol 25 BID , HCTZ / Triampterene ( as a replacment for lasix due to recurrent hypokalemia ), Benicar 20 mg QD , and Imdur 30 mg QD .
Infection / sepsis was not likely given she was afebrile and had no localizing sx with an improving lung exam and 02 requirement .
Given the patient 's recent RP bleed , there was concern for a recurrent bleed .
Her groin exam was unchanged .
Her Hct dropped from Hct 38.9 before fluids to 35.5 s/p 1.5L NS and was thought to be dilutional .
Repeat hcts were stable .
The patient was kept an additional two days to follow her hcts and titrate her BP meds .
As volume depletion was thought to be the cause of her low BP , only the BBlocker was restarted .
She was also placed on on low dose spironolactone as a K sparing diuretic and for BP control in addition to Toprol XL 25 mg QD for her coronary disease .
She tolerated these meds with SBP s in the high 90 s to 100 s and was therefore discharged on this regimen .
She will need follow up with her PCP within B week after discharge from the extended care facility for further BP titration and monitoring of her electrolytes .
2. Thrush : This is likely secondary to her steroid inhalers and PO prednisone for COPD exacerbation .
She was started on nystatin swish and swallow QID .
The patient was encouraged to take PO liquids to prevent volume depletion .
3. diarrhea : The patient has been having loose stools at night and was guiac pos x 2 .
Stool for C.diff toxin was sent x 1 and was negative .
Her bowel regimen is prn .
Gastroenteritis is possible but she has no vomiting and only occ nausea with meds .
There is no evidence of obstruction on AXR .
Therefore , the cause of her mild diarrhea ( few loose BM / liquid stool / night ) may be either viral or secondary to resolving abdominal hematoma with resultant irritation of GI system .
We have advised a BRAT diet .
4. guiac pos stool : Given the patient 's sx of GERD , current PO steroid regimen , and ASA for her stents , the ddx for her guiac positive stools would include gastritis / gastric ulcer in addition to lower GI pathology .
However , she has no vomiting and only mild nausea with medications .
She also has no gross blood per rectum and her hct is stable .
Upon discharge the patient was changed to a BID protonix regimen .
Dr. Valerio office was notified about the patient 's discharge plans and status .
She will need outpatient follow up for her guiac pos stools with endoscopy vs EGD +/- H.pylori serologies .
A copy of this dc summary will be faxed to her PCP to ensure proper follow up .
